CHANDIGARH: In a shocking turn in the case relating to sexual exploitation of an HIV-infected woman, involvement of some more people in the shameful act has come to the fore. This follows a revelation by the victim woman before the investigating agency.During the course of the investigation, the victim has reportedly given the description of some more people, who allegedly used to ���come��� to her with the main accused- James, a technician in PGI and Nekram, counsellor of Chandigarh AIDS Control Society, who were recently nabbed by UT police sleuths.Sleuths from the investigation team are saying the new revelations are being verified thoroughly and if something concrete comes through, investigation will be done accordingly.���The lady has given the description of some more people who used to come to her with the two main accused. But as she has failed to identify those men, it will take time to verify it all,��� a senior UT police officer told TOI. It may be recalled that two years after the issue of sexual exploitation of an HIV-infected woman came to light, UT police finally managed to arrest two persons including a PGI technician and a counsellor of Chandigarh AIDS Control Society around a week back. Both were arrested in the rape case under Section-376 of IPC at Manimajra police station.Cops had claimed it had come out in the investigation that during the counselling of an HIV-infected woman, both arrested accused used to seek sexual favours from her in lieu of providing expensive medicines to her free of cost and for other benefits related to her treatment.It had come to light that the victim had succumbed to demands of the accused and later, failing to fulfil their unwarranted demands including those for young females, she stopped visiting PGI for treatment. The matter was brought to National Human Rights Commission���s notice.
