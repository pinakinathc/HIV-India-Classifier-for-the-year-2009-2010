 NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable was allegedly bitten twice on his legs by an HIV positive truck driver in the national capital when he intervened in a fight he was having with his wife.   The incident took place in Jehangirpuri of North-West Delhi on March three when the constable went to the residence of the driver after his wife rung up and complained that she was being beaten up by him.   "We have heard about it. We are verifying it," Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-West) N S Bundela told PTI.   After receiving the call, two constables went to the residence of the truck driver where they saw the man beating up his wife, sources said.   One constable attended to the woman while the other tried to stop the truck driver from creating a scene, they said, adding it led to a scuffle between the two.   Both of them fell on the ground and the driver bit both legs of the constable. The bite was so hard that the constable's legs began bleeding, they said.   The constable went to a hospital later where doctors told him that he could have been bitten by a HIV-positive patient, the sources said.   The next day the constable went to the residence of the driver where his wife "confirmed" that her husband is HIV- positive.   The constable is reportedly on leave and had gone to his village in Haryana.
