 PUNE: As many as 55 inmates of the Yerawada Central Jail found to have HIV infection within a year of providing the testing and counselling facility. Acting on Bombay High Court's directives, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) had started the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) related facilities, as a pilot project, at the Yerawada and Amravati Central Jail in the state from October 2 last year. The Amravati Central Jail has reported 22 positive cases within a year.   The jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals having ICTCs.   "A total number of 55 inmates of the Yerawada Central Jail were found to have HIV infection in the last one year. Of them, eight inmates are put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 200," said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre. The number of HIV infected inmates has increased over the last three months. "Around 5 inmates test positive for HIV infection on an average every month," said Ingale.   When contacted Laxmi Pillai, deputy director of the state for ICTCs said, "There are around 182 jail inmates in the state who are found to have HIV infection. The Yerawada Central Jail has registered the highest number of cases among others."   Of the 55 positive inmates of the jail, six are women inmates . The rest 49 are all male inmates. Notably, history taken down of 10 HIV infected inmates has revealed that they were MSM (men six with men) cases, Ingale added.   When contacted Ramesh Deokar, state project director of MSACS said, "There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTC centres in the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal to this regard was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO) , but they have categorically said that they are ready to extend training but it is up to the state government to recruit workforce."
