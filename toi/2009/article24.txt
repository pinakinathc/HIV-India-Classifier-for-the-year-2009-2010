 CHANDIGARH: UT administrator Gen (Rtd) SF Rodrigues on Wednesday expressed concern at the growing number of AIDS and maternity mortality cases in city colonies and villages, despite various health programmes.   Inaugurating a health check-up and social welfare awareness camp at Mauli Jagran, Rodrigues made a case for developing an IT-enabled system for interconnecting super specialty hospitals in the region with PGI so that expert advice is available at the click of a button.   The city has forged partnerships with the community and integrated IT with rural health practices with contribution from all sectors like government hospitals, charitable clinics and other community based organizations engaged in patientcare by using latest technology, he said.   The administrator emphasized the need to adopt a synergic approach to preventive healthcare and public health issues like sanitation, hygiene and proper nutrition. During his visit to the stalls of State AIDS Control Society and Maternal and Child Protection Programme, Rodrigues asked heads of these programmes to conduct colonywise and villagewise surveys and take effective measures to tackle these problems by focusing attention on vulnerable areas.   Accompanied by wife Jean Rodrigues, he went around different stalls of social welfare activities and interacted with beneficiaries of various schemes including pension for old, disabled and widows, and financial assistance to poor people desirous of setting up their own businesses to earn a livelihood.
