 AHMEDABAD: The state healthcare system ruined his life but he still harbours hope in it for his battle against the deadly disease. Fate of 19-year-old Harsh Soni's life was decided much before he was born as he got HIV infection after his mother was given infected blood during pregnancy.   "Others gifted HIV infection to me and I have given myself bonheur. Enjoy life come what may, this is my antidote," says Soni.   Soni has finally managed to find a stable job. He was asked to leave from four jobs earlier when his bosses came to know about his HIV status. "My presence makes a few colleagues uncomfortable but I don't expect them to be nice," says Soni, who is working as a marketing executive.   Soni left studies midway when he couldn't take the attitude of his classmates. "I was kid then. Now, this attitude is a challenge to prove myself. I become nice to them hoping that they might not treat another HIV positive person the same way," says Soni, who lost his mother to the infection a few years after birth. The young lad who takes care to his expenses, tells everyone about his infection in the first meeting.   "My barber, mechanic, professional contacts, friends know about my HIV positive tag. I want them to accept me the way I am. If they don't, I move on. I have a lot to do in life and am currently looking for an HIV positive girl to get married," he says, hoping for a new drug to cure HIV to be invented soon.   (names have been changed)
