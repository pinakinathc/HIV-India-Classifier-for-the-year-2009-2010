JAIPUR: The state which takes pride in its heritage is not far behind from being included in the club of states having substantial number of children affected by AIDS. A recent survey by an NGO, supported by UNICEF, UNAID, UNDP and World Vision, has revealed that more than 1,000 children are orphaned and living with HIV positive, facing trauma and gross stigmatisation by society. In the state, there is only one child care centre at Jalore and that too is an NGO initiative. According to the survey, there are as many as 2.5 to 3 lakh people infected with the virus in the state.In fact, the entire Rajasthan does not have a special treatment centre for the HIV infected. ���There is a need to create a community support mechanism to assist infected children, especially those who are orphaned by the disease,��� said Brajesh Dubey, president, Rajasthan Network for People Living with HIV/AIDs (RNP+).To help these children escape from stigmatisation and social ostracism, the RNP+ runs a care home at Jalore which houses 14 such children.The story of Shanti Lal (name changed), an 18-year-old from Jalore, is quite heart-rending. ���I came to know about my infection at 9, and it was impossible for me to survive after my parents died but thanks to NACO ��� National Aids Control Organisation ��� I got treatment and I am still under medication,��� said Shanti Lal.He is now confident of fighting the disease with courage and promised to work for the care and support of HIV+ children. Dev (name changed), a 5-year-old from Churu, came with his HIV infected mother and brother. They were pushed out of their village after their father died of AIDS at the age of 30 in 2006. Now they are yet to get protection and shelter and the child is yet to be diagnosed properly.Similarly, Sunita (name changed), was driven out of their village in Churu district after her husband died of AIDS. She and her children are now HIV positive. Their life has become miserable since no support from any organisation has reached them so far.
