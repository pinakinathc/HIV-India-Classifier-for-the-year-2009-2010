 VARANASI: Now, India and Australia have joined hands in collaborative research for using nanotechnology in renewable energy and family planning methods, including prevention of sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS.   According to Dr S Bandyopadhyay, associate professor and nanotechnology specialist, School of Material Science and Technology, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, the collaborative research has started under Australia India Science Research Funding (AISRF) programme, where both the governments will be spending 50 million Australian dollars in five years (one million Australian dollars annually).   Dr Bandyopadhyay was talking to reporters after the conclusion of three-day international conference on emerging trends in electronics and photonic devices and systems (Electro-2009) at Banaras Hindu University on Thursday.   Saying that premier Indian Institution including IIT, New Delhi and Cardiff University, Australia, were already working together under a project to increase charge capacity of storage cell for energy conservation using nanotechnology, he added collaborative research between the two countries had started for increasing thermal stability and conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNT) using different polymers.   "CNTs alone cannot achieve high conductivity and stability because of their low capacitance and low surface area in compared with active carbons. They need composite substrate in the form of polymers that increases the power output," he informed.   It may be mentioned here that Dr Bandyopadhyay has done significant research on CNT/epoxy composite that increases the mechanical strength of CNT (almost four to five times of aluminium), besides increasing its electric conducting potential.   "The nanoparticles also have great potential in family planning methods including prevention of STD like HIV/AIDS," he added while indicating at a proposed project that would be launched next year. "I have already attended the first round of meeting with medical director, New South Wales (Sydney) and the next meeting is due in the month of January next year," he said.   It is also worth mentioning here that the health project incorporating nanotechnology will witness multidisciplinary approach from UNSW including its medical department and health administration of the region. A contraceptive making company from Kerala (India) is also a contributor to the project.   "We are confident that multidisciplinary approach using nanotechnology and targeted drug delivery would change the face of medical world in the coming days," he said. "We have already changed from using copper wire as contraceptives to copper nanoparticles that have shown greater efficacy despite their small sizes," he said.   About the Australia-India Science Research Funding Programme   # The programme began in 2006, where Australian and Indian governments contributed 20 million Australian dollars each for three years   # Now, the programme has been extended for five years and the contribution of the governments has reduced to 10 million Australian dollars per year   # As many as six research experts each from these two countries have been included in the programme   # The department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi is a major contributor to the programme   # Presently, two projects on use of nanotechnology in renewable energy and family planning methods including prevention of STD like HIV/AIDS have started under the programme   Areas of research where nanotechnology can do wonders   # Increasing thermal stability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using composite polymers   # Increasing electrical conductivity of CNTs using polymers   # Increasing charge capacitance for storage cell in energy   # Increasing total power output performance   # Targeted drug delivery using nanoparticles for HIV/AIDS   # Contraceptives using nanoparticles   (Source: Dr S Bandyopadhyay, nanotechnology specialist, University of New South Wales, Australia)
