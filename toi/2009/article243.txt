 CHANDIGARH: The two-pronged strategy adopted by the UT health department, in collaboration with the State AIDS Control Society, to meet the challenge posed by spread of AIDS, has started to pay dividends.   UT officials revealed not only the number of deaths due to AIDS but also the percentage of HIV positive cases has come down.   Project director of the society Vanita Gupta said while 114 persons had fallen victim to the deadly disease in 2007, the toll came down to 97 in 2008; and 61 in the first eight months of 2009.   Meanwhile, out of the 8,924 persons screened, 1,066 (12%) were found HIV positive in 2006; whereas out of 13,630 screened, 1,144 (8%) were found positive in 2007; out of 17,405 screened, 1,239 (7%) were found positive in 2008; and out of 15,162 screened, only 780 (5%) were found positive till August 2009.   Two years ago, the society started 13 target intervention programmes four each among the sex and migrants workers; two among mms and intra-virus druggists; and one each for industry, BPO sector and composite segment - in collaboration with NGOs to educate people of the danger posed by the disease and encourage them to adopt preventive measures. More and more people are coming forward for AIDS test, Gupta added.
