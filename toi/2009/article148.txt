 PUNE: The Union Budget has allocated Rs 281.1 crore for 12 autonomous research and development institutions across the country, including the Pune-based National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) under the department of biotechnology (DBT) of the Ministry of Science and Technology.   The NCCS has proposed the launch of programmes for treating diabetes and identification of microbicides to prevent contracting HIV infection and its transmission.   Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, NCCS director G C Mishra said, "We have been doing research for treating diabetes for the past 10 years. We have experimented successfully on mice and will now collaborate with the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, for taking this study a step further and conduct experiments on larger animals."   National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi; Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneshwar; Institute of Stem Cell Research and Regenerating medicine, Bangalore are the other autonomous institutions under the DBT that will benefit from this budgetary allocation.   Besides NCCS' work on diabetes, the second project to have been funded by the allocation will be their work in preventing the contraction and spread of HIV infection.   Mishra said, "We are currently looking for chemists as partners to work on the project. We will try to identify anti-viral compounds with the potential for development of microbicides to prevent HIV infection and transmission. We need chemists who can help us with testing these compounds."   The NCCS focuses on basic research in the area of Cell Biology, Cancer Biology, Infectious diseases, Immunology, Molecular Biology, Proteomics, Genomics, Diabetes and Tissue Engineering that leads to enhancement in understanding the events at molecular level.   The NCCS has also proposed to establish a centre for re-generative biology. "It will be more of a NCCS II campus. At present we are hunting for land to set up this centre," Mishra said.
