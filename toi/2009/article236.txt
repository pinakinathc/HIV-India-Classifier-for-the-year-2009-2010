 LUCKNOW: Twenty-year-old Poonam Rajput (name changed) is forced to live on a roadside along with her one-year-old daughter. She was thrown out by her husband after she tested HIV+ a few days back.   Ironically, Poonam's husband Suresh Kumar Rajput is also HIV+ but refuses to keep his wife on the grounds that he cannot bear the cost of her treatment. Her father, too, has refused to give her shelter fearing social stigma.   Though Lucknow Network for Positive People (LNP+) that found the women a few days ago is trying for her rehabilitation, the episode has exposed absence of government mechanism in the state to provide relief to abandoned HIV positive women and children and work for their rehabilitation.   Poonam filed a complaint with the State Women Commission (SWC), and on its intervention, the husband agreed to take back the baby but has refused to give shelter to wife. ''Earlier, Suresh had agreed to take us back, but now he has gone back on his word and is asking for divorce,'' said Poonam, who is planning to knock at the doors of SWC again. Suresh, a small-time worker, said he has a limited income and cannot bear the burden of his wife.   Poonam, a resident of Shahjahanpur, has been in Lucknow for the past two months to pursue her case with the SWC. The money she brought exhausted in a month and she was forced to live on the roadside when found by LNP+ activists. For the time being, the LNP+ has allowed Poonam to stay in its office but it wants government to come up with a suitable plan for shelter and rehabilitation of such victims.
