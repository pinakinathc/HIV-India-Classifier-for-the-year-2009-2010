  PATNA: Governor Debanand Kunwar on Sunday appealed to members of medical fraternity and the media to play an important role in tackling HIV and AIDS.   "While medical professionals could play an important role in treatment of the patients, mediapersons could play a similar role to create proper awareness among the masses about HIV and AIDS," the governor said. He was speaking at a 'Doctor and Media Interaction Workshop' as a part of Society For Medicare-sponsored "HIV Bhagao-Bihar Bachao" campaign.   He said the saying — prevention is better than cure — also applies to this disease. Migratory population is more prone to such diseases and NGOs must target them while taking up awareness campaign, the governor said.
