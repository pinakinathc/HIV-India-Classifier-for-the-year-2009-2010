 MUMBAI: Posts of medical officers in Maharashtra's jails are yet to be filled despite the Bombay high court ordering the state to look into the issue of HIV-positive inmates.   Advocate Yug Chaudhary told the court that despite the HC appointing a committee to monitor the facilities for HIV-positive inmates, posts of medical officers were yet to be filled.   Public prosecutor Satish Borulkar blamed it on the unwillingness of doctors to join prison services. The high court has directed the additional chief secretary, public health department, and IG of prisons to file an affidavit in two weeks on the measures taken.
