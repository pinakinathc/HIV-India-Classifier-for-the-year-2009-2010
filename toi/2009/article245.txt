 LUDHIANA: Around 11 Class IV railway employees have fallen prey to the deadly disease AIDS. This has come to light during a recent medical check-up camp organized by the railway health authorities in Ferozepur division.   Doctors who conducted the camp believe that lack of awareness, drug abuse and migration from their homes are specific reasons for the workers to become diseased. It becomes difficult to create awareness among the lower income groups due to their attitude and their habit of taking alcohol.   Chief medical supervisor (CMS) of Ferozepur division Dr NK Gupta said though they have detected 11 HIV+ cases, the number is in control as compared to other railway divisions. He asserted that they have decided to arrange several awareness camps for these employees to disperse ample information about the disease and its complications among the staff. It is basically because of transferable nature of their job that they indulge in such malpractices as there is no check over them staying away from their families, he reasons.   On the condition of anonymity, an employee informed that the authorities have woken up to their condition but that only detection would not be sufficient. The authorities should also arrange for their treatment by providing adequate infrastructure in the railway medical units. Initiating these camps to improve health of the employees, the authorities conducted medical checkup camps at Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana railway medical units. Meanwhile, in a similar medical camp held in Maharashtra in September, they had detected 268 HIV+ cases.
