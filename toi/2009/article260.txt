PANAJI: The children's court has for the second time rejected the bail application filed by an HIV positive accused arrested for having intercourse with a minor boy and allegedly transmitting the disease to him.In his application before the court, the accused claimed that the investigation in the case has been completed and a chargesheet has been filed against him. He pointed out that he requires a special diet and timely medical treatment as he is suffering from AIDS. He further said that he is unable to get the required treatment as he is in custody for the last 11 months.The prosecution opposed the application on grounds that the 13-year-old victim and his family were in trauma since the victim tested positive for HIV. The accused had committed a heinous offence and was not entitled for bail, the prosecution contended. Rejecting the bail application, the president of the children's court, B P Deshpande, observed: "No material has been brought on record that the condition or health of the accused is deteriorating in custody and that he is not getting timely treatment and medicines." As the trial has begun, the court noted that the victim's cross examination is presently on. If at this stage the accused is released, there is every possibility that he will threaten the victim boy, the court said. "The nature of offence is very serious and heinous and punishment could go up to life imprisonment. The conditions are such that the accused is not at all entitled for bail," the judge observed.
