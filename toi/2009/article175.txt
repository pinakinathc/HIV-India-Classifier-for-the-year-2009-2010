 CHENNAI: Two days after a young woman dragged the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) to court for having used her photo and that of her daughter without consent, the Madras high court pulled up Tansacs and directed it to remove all banners featuring the woman and her child within a week.   The order came not before Transacs told the high court that the aggrieved woman had ''an ulterior motive to demoralise'' the agency. The woman and her daughter have sought compensation of Rs 1 crore from Tansacs.   Noting that the picture of the woman and her then one-year-old daughter was still available on a website, Tansacs counsel said: ''The petitioners, after allowing the photographs to go public, that too for commercial purposes, cannot now make a hue and cry that without their consent Tansacs published their photographs in the banner.''   Justice K Suguna, before whom the matter came up for admission on Wednesday, permitted the petitioner's counsel, G Mohanakrishnan, to implead Sasi Advertising Agency in the case. When the matter was taken up, advocate Rajasekaran submitted that because of the ''reckless act'' of Tansacs, the woman's character was suspected by her husband, and the child too suffered isolation.
