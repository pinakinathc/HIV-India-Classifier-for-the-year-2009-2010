 ALLAHABAD: A two-day workshop sponsored by the National Aids Control Organisation to impart HIV/AIDS awareness to pilgrims coming to the Magh Mela would be organised by the Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital by a camp of Regional Field Publicity Directorate on February 3 and 4.   Giving this information medical superintendant, Dr JK Gupta said that AIDS has already been accepted as a biggest challenge in the whole world. The disease has taken into its grip the most productive age group 15 to 49 years. In some African countries it is the cause of highest number of deaths and has played a major role in blocking the production capacity and development in some countries.   He added that the disease is also growing at an alarming pace in India and as per figures by the year 2005 about 52 lakh persons were infected with AIDS and the country occupies the second place in the world after South Africa for highest number of HIV infected.   Keeping this in mind it is important that all sections of society should stand united with a specific strategy to fight against the disease. "The effort would only succeed when all the organisations of our country would participate in this endeavour," he added.
