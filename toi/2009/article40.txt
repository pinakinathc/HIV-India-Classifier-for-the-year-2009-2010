 HALDIA: A 14-year-old thalassaemic girl from Tamluk in East Midnapore has been detected HIV+ after receiving blood from a government blood bank. The East Midnapore chief medical officer of health (CMOH) has initiated an inquiry and promised action against those found guilty of negligence.   The girl has been living with thalassaemia since she was six months old and had to undergo regular blood transfusions. She last received blood from the East Midnapore Hospital bank a fortnight ago after which she developed some unnatural symptoms, including fever.   A blood test revealed that she had contracted HIV. The School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata also confirmed this. "I have two daughters. Our family has now been ostracized. The blood bank is to blame for what happened to my daughter," said the victim's father. CMOH Rabi Kinkar Nayek said that he has received a complaint and has ordered an inquiry.
