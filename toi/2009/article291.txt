    Actors and prominent residents of the city were present at a city college to lend their support to a unique programme to create awareness on AIDS and avoid discrimination against HIV infected children. A massive human chain in the form of the Red Ribbon was formed. There was an eagerness with which youngsters volunteered for the programme. Banners adorned the venue as celebs and other guests were seen interacting with HIV infected children.  (Contributed by Rubeena Ismail)
