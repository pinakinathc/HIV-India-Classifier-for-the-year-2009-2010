 A sexual gel might curb the spread of AIDS by stopping cells vulnerable to the virus from rushing to the site of infection, according to a study of monkeys.   Four of five monkeys treated with the gel, which contains a generic compound approved for use in people, were protected from an animal version of the virus, said researchers.   After years of failure, researchers are now finding drugs that help protect men and women during sex from the AIDS virus. The compound in the new study might be combined with other preventive drugs into a successful gel, said Ashley Haase, a University of Minnesota microbiologist who helped lead the research team in Minneapolis. In the study, Haase and Patrick Schlievert, of the University of Minnesota, tested monkeys with a drug called glycerol monolaurate, or GML, added to Johnson & Johnson's K-Y Warming Liquid, a sex gel.
