 DUBAI: International cricketers, including India opener Virender Sehwag, have urged the international cricket community to support calls for greater awareness and fight against HIV on the eve of World AIDS Day on Tuesday.   "Cricketers use protection when playing the game and it's the same in life as well. Everyone should take the necessary steps to protect themselves from HIV," said Sehwag.   "Through my work with THINK WISE I hope we can take this message further to help reduce HIV infection levels across the world," he added.   THINK WISE campaign which helps to raise awareness about HIV amongst the cricket community also includes Australian pacer Nathan Bracken, England women's team player Isa Guha, Sri Lankan skipper Kumar Sangakkara, South African captain Graeme Smith, an ICC release said.   "What cricket does well is bring people together in common spirit. We are doing our bit on World AIDS Day to help raise awareness, reduce discrimination and ultimately help to prevent HIV infections," said Sangakkara, who is currently touring India for a bilateral series.   "It is fantastic to see cricket being used as a force for social good and I hope the THINK WISE initiative will continue to gather momentum throughout the cricket community," he added.
