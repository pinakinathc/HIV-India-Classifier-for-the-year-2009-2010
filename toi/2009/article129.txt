 RAJKOT: An HIV positive woman was branded as one at a government hospital in Jamnagar on Saturday and paraded through the wards to warn other patients about her status.   Nurses at the Guru Govind Singh Hospital stuck a label that read 'HIV Serum positive' on her forehead. Labels are pasted on foreheads of dead bodies after post-mortem examination.   For the woman in her mid-20s, who is a resident of Jamnagar, the trauma came immediately after the shock of getting to know that she is HIV positive and then going through an abortion so that her baby is not born with the deadly virus.  The woman had come to the gynaecology department for a check-up on Wednesday. Tests confirmed that she was HIV positive and doctors advised her to terminate the pregnancy, which was done.   On Saturday, she met the gynaecology department head Dr Nalini Anand. After going through her reports, the doctor told her to stay away from other patients and told the nurses about her health condition.   The nurses pasted the label on her forehead and took her around the hospital campus. It was mid-way through the parade that volunteers of 'Jamnagar District Network of People Living With HIV' noticed her. They immediately took up the matter with hospital superintendent Dr Arun Vyas.   Expressing shock over the incident, health minister Jay Narayan Vyas told TOI that he had instituted an inquiry and asked two doctors and a nurse to proceed on leave till completion of the inquiry.   TOI has learnt that the two doctors under scrutiny are Nalini Anand and Dipti Joshi and the nurse is Prafula Parmar.   The NGO took the victim out of the hospital and she is at present with her husband, who is also HIV positive. "She is traumatised and told us she does not want to live any more now that everyone knows the truth," said the NGO's head Preeti Chavda.
