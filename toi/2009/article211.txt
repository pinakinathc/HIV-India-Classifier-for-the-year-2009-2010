 NEW DELHI: In a significant discovery, scientists may have found the most potent weapon to date to combat HIV. Bringing hope to the idea of developing an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, scientists have discovered two highly powerful new antibodies that neutralised all major forms of the virus from the body of an African man.   An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. Interestingly, this African man is part of a select community on this planet who are infected with HIV but show no symptoms or deterioration of health, thanks to these antibodies.   Scientists associated with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) at the Scripps Research Institute in the US said these antibodies had also revealed an Achilles heel on the virus.   This major discovery, reported in the journal Science on Friday, also found that these two antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines.   Experts will now look at exactly where the antibodies bind to the virus. This will tell them which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The team of scientists, which made the discovery, said they also identified what genes the donor's body used to build the neutralising antibodies.   Researchers believe they can create an effective vaccine if they are able to get the human body to produce such neutralising antibodies before exposure to HIV.
