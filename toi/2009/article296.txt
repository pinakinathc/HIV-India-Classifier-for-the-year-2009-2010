MELBOURNE: An HIV-positive man infected his wife with the virus which can cause AIDS, as he injected his blood into her body while she was sleeping. It is believed the man wanted to transmit the disease to her so that she would start having sex with him again, the Sunday Star times reported today. The man, 35, admitted infecting his wife, 33, the first case of its kind in New Zealand, an offence that carries a maximum 14 years' of imprisonment. In court documents, the woman described how her husband twice pricked her with a sewing needle laced with his infected blood. She described how in May last year she discovered a sting-like mark on her left thigh and two days later she awoke to a stinging feeling in her leg. During a routine check-up four months later she found she was HIV-positive and confronted her husband who admitted dipping a needle in his blood and pricking her with it. "All he said (was) he was sorry. He said: "I used needles on you because I wanted you to be the same as me so that you can live with me and you won't leave me," she said. The man discovered he was HIV-positive during the compulsory health checks done in New Zealand in 2004. But the woman and their children were not infected with the virus, the report said.The woman said she wanted to maintain the relationship for the sake of the children but refused to have sex with her husband as she feared she would contract the disease.
