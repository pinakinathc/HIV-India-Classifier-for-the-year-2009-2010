A team of 14 students from China and Taiwan surveyed Punjab and Haryana and also liaised with a local NGO, ���Butterfly���, based in Panchkula to learn about HIV counselling and management of the disease. Talking about the HIV and AIDS scenario in Taiwan, Jaffery, a pharmaceutical science student said, ���Sex education has been given to students in junior high schools and the government is providing money to students for implementing HIV and AIDS awareness programme unlike in India.���These interns, in their late 20s, are on a mission to learn more about how NGOs are run and to do something for the vulnerable groups. ���We could then go back to our country to contribute to our society too. We have seen the way these projects are run in these states and can adopt certain methodologies from here,��� added Yao Tuo from China, majoring in development studies for a bachelor���s degree at China Agricultural University, China.
