CHANDIGARH: When a two-year fight for justice finally landed two health workers accused of sexually harassing an HIV positive woman behind bars, the victim had heaved a sigh of relief. Little did she know that this very justice would apparently become an impediment in her way to better health. In 2007, James, a senior technician at PGI and Nekram, a counsellor with Chandigarh AIDS Control Society, were arrested under rape charges after they were accused of seeking sexual favours from the victim, who is HIV positive. After their arrest, the woman had hoped of continuing her treatment at PGI. However, she alleged, cops lost her medical records, making her unable to do so. ������Police misplaced some of the medical reports that I required to continue my treatment at PGI. For six months, my health was held at ransom to official carelessness,������ the woman alleged. The records reportedly included reports that confirmed the woman���s HIV status.Interestingly, in what seems like an action that resulted from media���s prodding, police handed over the medical file to the woman on Thursday. ������I was taken by surprise when the investigating officer called me on Thursday evening, asking me to collect the papers. At least I can start my treatment again,������ the HIV positive patient added. However, police denied the allegations that the records had been displaced. ������The file was kept for investigation. Until the inquiry is complete, we cannot hand over the original documents to anyone,������ said Gurjit Kaur, the investigating officer in the case at Woman and Child Support Unit.
