 CHANDIGARH: Bringing a ray of fresh hope for the HIV afflicted, especially those serving in the armed forces, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday passed an order saying a soldier cannot be denied promotion because of his HIV positive status.   Justice Permod Kohli passed the judgment while allowing a writ petition preferred by one Lance Naik of Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).   The petitioner, who was detected with the virus during a routine medical checkup by ITBP authorities in 1995, had appeared personally before HC to take up his case. He was posted in Dehradun then.
