      These characters have been created as part of a new virtual clinic under study at the university.
      
      
      With names like Isabelle, Martin, Marc, Genevieve, these virtual peers can help HIV patients in their struggle to adhere to their anti-retroviral treatment programmes, a university statement said Wednesday.
      
      
      This unique, innovative and user-friendly web programme is called VIH-TAVIE, which in French means for nurse-assisted, HIV treatment and teaching for life.
      
      
      The online programme will help HIV patients integrate daily treatment into their lifestyle whether they are at a restaurant or travelling, the statement said.
      
      
      It also helps them in dealing with the side-effects of .
      
      
      The web programme also provides comfort to patients who are confronted with life-changing trials and tribulations, not to mention questioning and anxiety that may result from therapy, the university said.
      
      
      Participants in the study say they have gained better control on their condition after their online experience with virtual peers.
      
      
      "Although HIV treatments have saved their lives, integrating antiretroviral drugs into a strict timetable can become a long-term challenge, restricting and demanding. Many people get discouraged and feel powerless about the changes in their lives," said Jose Cote who is the principal researcher of the VIH-TAVIE project.
      
      
      However, the virtual assistant, as personified by the nurse, engages patients in the development of self-management skills for their antiretroviral therapy.
