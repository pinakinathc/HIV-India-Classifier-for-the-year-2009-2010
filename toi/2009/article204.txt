  MANIPAL: Joint participation of private stakeholders with the government for public causes will yield results, says Udupi DC P Hemalatha. 
  
  She was speaking after inaugurating the District Polio Plus Orientation Planning Meet and AIDS Awareness and Prevention Seminar organized by the Rotary International District 3180 here on Saturday. 
  
  "Though not a single case of polio has been detected in the state since 2004, we should be cautious as this part of the state has a large number of migrants," she cautioned. Polio eradication programmes with follow up activities are being taken by the government health department officials in a systematic way, she added.
  
  She said "Udupi district has been categorized under the red zone when it comes to AIDS. Over 1,000 HIV positive cases are reported every year in the district. Awareness must be created among the public regarding the disease and the consequences," she felt.
