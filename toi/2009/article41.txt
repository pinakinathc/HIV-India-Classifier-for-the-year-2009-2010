 BORIVLI: Upset that he would not be cured of his HIV infection, a 40-year-old man from Borivli (W) ended his life on Thursday by slashing his throat with a kitchen knife.   Police officials said the victim was a garage mechanic and his infection came to light when his wife happened to go for a medical check-up five years ago; doctors suggested he, too, should undergo a test when she was found to be HIV-positive. The test revealed that the man was HIV-positive, after which he went into depression, the officials added.   The victim's wife told the police that they were undergoing treatment but he would keep telling her that they would never be cured of the disease. He also suggested that they both end their lives. But as the couple had a daughter, the wife was against this idea, the officials said.   The man made an abortive attempt to end his life a few months ago when he consumed bleaching powder. He survived and started going to a healing centre in Panchgani and even went to a psychiatrist. He, however, often refused to take medicines.   The woman got a message on Thursday morning that her husband had cut his throat at a place near their house. She rushed to the spot and took him to Bhagwati Hospital. He died on being brought to hospital.
