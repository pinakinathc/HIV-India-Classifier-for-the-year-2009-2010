CHANDIGARH: The administration has decided to lend a helping hand to the HIV infected patients in the region, besides children whose parents have died due to the virus. UT administrator Gen (Retd) SF Rodrigues on Thursday decided to collaborate with Punjab to set up a centre with efficient support system for such families.Presiding over a high-level meeting attended by finance secretary (FS) Sanjay Kumar, secretary to Governor MP Singh, Punjab health secretary Satish Chandra and other senior officers of AIDS Control Society of Punjab, Gen Rodrigues said the facility proposed to be set up in or near the city would cater to the entire region. He asked the FS and the director of health department to identify the site and other infrastructural support needed to run the centre. He also urged the officers present to identify NGOs in the region who could help in this initiative.He further hoped that a suitable plan would be formulated to impart education to such children to ensure their proper rehabilitation in life. Children were increasingly being afflicted with HIV/AIDS and also suffering hardships due to absence of child-oriented support system, he rued.Meanwhile, revealing that there were 6225 AIDS cases in Punjab, out of which 385 were children of different age groups, Chandra gave an account of the measures taken for their treatment. ���All these patients are given anti-retroviral therapy through various centres in the state. A well-structured system including integrated counseling and testing services are provided to them,��� he added.
