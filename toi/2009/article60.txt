 RAJKOT: First ever magazine in Gujarati language to spread AIDS prevention awareness was launched in the city on Thursday.   "There are few magazines on the subject in the country, but most of them are in English. The way AIDS is spreading among the different segments of the society, there was a need to start a publication dedicated to AIDS-related details in vernacular languages," said Arun Dave of AIDS Prevention Club.   He said there are more than 1.45 lakh HIV infected patients in Gujarat, and in Rajkot district, the figure is around 16,000 which include 6,000-odd in Rajkot city.
