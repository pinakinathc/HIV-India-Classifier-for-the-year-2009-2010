 NAGPUR: The district collectorate of Nagpur had been taking up the cause of fighting against the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the past. It has now been appointed the implementing authority in the AIDS campaign on August 12 on the occasion of International Youth Day.   The programme, which will be organised under the aegis of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), will be a large-scale AIDS awareness campaign targeted at youngsters. Many college students as well as members of many NGOs have been invited for the function.   The programme has been divided into two parts. In the first part, a rally on AIDS awareness will be taken out at 8.30 am on Friday from the office of the deputy director of health services near Deekshabhoomi in the city. The rally will culminate at the Matru Sewa Sangh in Sitabuldi after an hour. It is here that the second part of the programme will take place.   From 11 am, a youth gathering will be organised at the premises of the Matru Sewa Sangh. Here, lectures and presentations on the modes of transfer of HIV, and preventive methods will be delivered. Another programme will aim at changing the adverse mentality projected towards an HIV-infected person. More than 1,000 people are expected to attend the gathering.   That the several awareness campaigns on AIDS that have been conducted in the city on various occasions are actually paying off, and are doing what they are aimed to do, is evident from the figures of the number of people tested in the district and the number of those who have been found newly affected by HIV.   From 2002 to 2008, while the number of those who got themselves examined for HIV has multiplied by a dozen, the number of those who tested positive for the virus had shot up in between, but has come down to about one and the half times the original.
