LUDHIANA: With AIDS spreading its tentacles across the globe, city residents seem to have woken up to the menace of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). More so, the health department has also joined the bandwagon in spreading awareness and reducing the prevalence rate of STDs in the district.Taking a step in this direction, the civil hospital has started placing contraceptives (condoms) in all out patient departments (OPD) and has appointed councillors to educate masses on the subject.Earlier, it was the promotion of ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres), then establishing an anti-retroviral centre and now, spreading awareness among people to use contraceptives. Indeed, a councillor has also been appointed to guide people suffering from STD and will suggest remedial measures.According to the information, contraceptives for men and women will now be available in every OPD, including eye, gynaecology, orthopaedics, general and others.Dr Jasbir Singh, in charge, ICTC centre, civil hospital, said, ���Though the exact number of HIV cases are unknown, the incidence rate is high, especially in the pockets of Ludhiana, Bathinda, Moga.���He, however, said many people were now coming forward to take contraceptives without hesitation.It is worth mentioning that the number of people visiting the civil hospital for HIV tests has increased with each passing year.Data reveals that till 2007, a total 6,473 tests were done and out of these, 358 tested positive and this included 231 males.Similarly, 17 tested positive in 2003, 24 in 2004, 41 in 2005, 51 in 2006 and 155 were registered till June, 2007.Talking on the issue, Harpreet Singh, a local resident, said, ���Putting condom dispensers at public places is a western concept and our society will take time to adapt to this practice. In cities like Chandigarh, machines have been put up where people put a coin and get a condom. However, there is no such facility here.���Giving details about the measures being taken by the Aids Control Society, Dr Geetika, Aids Control Programme, said, ���The aim is to spread awareness among the masses and for this, the department has already tied up with private practitioners. The moment the practitioners come across any case, they will treat it and the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) will provide kits, including supply of medicines for 14 days. More so, NACO is planning to install condom machines at public places.���On being asked about the prevalence rate of STDs, she said, the exact cases are unknown but according to NACO, 3,000 persons had been affected by STDs in the district.
