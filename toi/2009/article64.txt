 HISAR: In a heart-warming tale of "true love" coming out of Haryana hinterland, notorious for its skewed sex ratio, an HIV/AIDS patient from Sindhwa village of the district has arranged for a wedding of his wife to another man.   "It took some time, but she finally agreed to give her consent for remarriage," Kamal (name changed) told TOI.   A matriculate, Kamal had married young, about three years ago, and was waiting to bring his bride home. However, when it was time to visit his in-law's place for the gauna (when bride comes to stay with her husband), he got to know of his HIV positive status.   Though shocked and traumatised, he refused to give himself to despair and told his wife about it the day she came to live with him, convincing her to lead a life without him. "When she did consent to marry again, I started looking for a suitable match, and one auspicious day, solemnised her marriage". The marriage took place this Wednesday.   A relieved man today, Kamal spends his days tending to the fields. "I have never visited a woman in my life. Maybe, I contracted the virus through an infected needle. It (marriage of wife) was a difficult decision. But I was clear in my mind that I could not ruin an innocent woman's life. I now plan to launch a public awareness campaign about HIV/AIDS."   The villagers have already started calling him their hero. "He has taken the right step and saved the life of a woman from being ruined," claimed his neighbour Nihal Singh.
