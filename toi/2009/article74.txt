 KOLKATA: Moved by the apathy to Khundrakpam Pradip Kumar Singh, the Indian Body Building and Fitness Federation (IBBFF) on Sunday decided to support the HIV positive body builder who has set example for various walks of life.   "He is a living example of dedication and determination. By competing in the senior national championship, he has yet again proved that HIV positive is not the end of the road.   "We will give him a special award for his determination and grit. We will do our best to support him and make sure that he does not feel deprived," IBBFF executive director Amit Swami said.   Swami, who is also the assistant secretary general of Asian Body Building and Fitness Federation, announced that the 38-year-old from Manipur will get a special award in the upcoming Asian Championship in Tehran in August.   Showering praise for the 'never say die' attitude of Pradip Kumar, Swami said, "HIV positive persons are not barred from any competition. We just make sure that the competitors don't take anabolic steroids. In fact, we must appreciate Pradip Kumar for his efforts. It needs lot of energy and courage."
