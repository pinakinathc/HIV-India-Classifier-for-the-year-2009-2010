 BANGALORE: The Rotary Club of Bangalore Cantonment launched a programme for the underprivileged -- a school for HIV patients. The initiative is part of Rotary Club's silver jubilee celebrations.   The school building will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 20 lakh and donated to Deena Nilaya, a destitute home in Kothanur on Hennur Road.   Also, Rotary Club started free computer classes for unemployed persons six months ago. Two batches have already completed their course and received employment. The classes are held at the `Rotary House of Learning' on Promenade Road.   The club will complete 25 years on Thursday. Started in 1984 with 34 members, the club has 70 members now. Its services covered midday meals, self-help schemes, polio eradication, etc.   "We are extremely proud of our contribution to society. But there's a lot more to do," said the club's secretary D C Shivdev.
