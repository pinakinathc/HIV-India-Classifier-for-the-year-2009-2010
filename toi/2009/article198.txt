ALLAHABAD: Just how ineffective have been both the Central and state governments' unceasing campaign regarding AIDS awareness was painfully evident when an 8-year-old HIV positive kid, Raju (name changed), was stigmatised and thrown out of a government primary school in Belamundi, roughly 50 km from here.But someone was doing his job, and Raju's sorry fate was averted when a UP basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Brajesh Mishra found that the school headmaster had struck off Raju's name — along with two of his siblings' — from the roster during a surprise check. In fact, on learning of the stigmatisation, Mishra sought out Raju and, holding him in his arms, gave an impromptu AIDS awareness demonstration, even as gawking parents — whose protests were responsible for Raju's plight — came to terms with it. Attendance in this school has dwindled drastically. From a total of 212, the number of kids in the last one week has dropped to 15-20. Mishra has now requested the DM to send doctors to Belamundi to educate the villagers. ''It would be a pity if Raju is denied the opportunity to study,'' he told TOI.All this kerfuffle has left Raju perplexed. A student of class four, he has been through worse — for instance when his mother died of AIDS in 2004. He faintly remembers her and the better times when they lived in Allahabad's Khusro Nagar. His parents cultivated a small patch of land and made garlands to sell in the flower mandi. Things were tough but tolerable until his father, too, died of AIDS two years ago. Now orphans, Raju and his two siblings were packed off by neighbours to their reluctant grandparents.
