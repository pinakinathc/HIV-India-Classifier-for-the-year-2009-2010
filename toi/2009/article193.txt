 MUMBAI: Irked by the state government's failure to provide care and treatment to HIV +ve prisoners, the Bombay HC on Friday directed principal secretary (home) Anna Dani to visit jails in the state and submit a report to the court in a week.   "Should somebody's death await your discussions?'' said a division bench after the state counsel told the court that a committee had been formed to work out a plan of action.   The court was informed that six HIV +ve prisoners had died in Yerawada Central Jail in Pune in the last six months alone because of lack of treatment. "All your proposals are fine but what are you doing about people who are already sick in jails?'' the judges said. The court asked the state to explain why prisoners with HIV should not be released if the state was unable to provide them with medical aid. Advocate amicus curiae Yug Chaudhary said there were provisions in the Maharashtra Prison Remission of Sentence Rules to release prisoners with incurable diseases or those on the verge of death.   The court has asked Dani to visit 10 jails and the undersecretary will visit five prisons before submitting their reports.
