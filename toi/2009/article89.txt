CHANDIGARH: An HIV positive man raised the roof at central treasury office on Wednesday when he threatened to kill himself following UT reportedly turning a deaf ear to his pleas for the job of a chowkidar for the past two years.Visibly running out of patience, Rakesh Kumar, 30, approached joint financial commissioner Raji P Shrivastava, special secretary finance, and warned her that if he further remained unemployed, something drastic could befall him.I have been trying my luck at private places also but my HIV status comes in the way, said Kumar. Apparently living under squalid conditions with a friend who sometimes helps him with finances, Kumar claimed, Whatever little money I have is spent on my treatment which costs around Rs 10,000 a month. I wont be able to continue this way without a job. I have also written to the governor and deputy commissioner, but none has come forward with help.Confirming Rakesh���s fit of anger, Shrivastava added, He has written a complaint in which he has held me culpable for anything that may happen to him. But he is demanding a job which has not been advertised. Moreover, I can���t give him a job without following procedures. He���s also overaged to get the chowkidar���s job.Stepping in at this juncture was State AIDS Control Society, which hoped to help provided the election commission did not object to work being offered at a time when elections were on in the country. Integrated Counselling and Training Centre will have an opening of 10 posts for HIV positive people with a monthly salary of Rs 3,000 as part of its outreach program. We have requested the election commissioner to exempt these recruitments from model code of conduct, said Vineeta Gupta, director, UT SACS.
