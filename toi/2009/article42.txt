 MUMBAI: A day after they called an indefinite strike at Azad Maidan, around 24 workers from HIV-testing centres fell ill on Saturday and were admitted to G T Hospital. Around 2,000 staffers belonging to the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), who are on year-long contracts, are demanding that the contract be increased to three years. Also, they want the apex AIDS body to do away with six-monthly exams which are conducted to test their knowledge.   "We have been approaching government authorities since July 2008, but in vain,'' said Satish Patil of the Maharashtra Rajya AIDS Niyantran Sanghatana. The Mumbai AIDS body had, incidentally, sorted out a similar problem three months ago.   The protest by counsellors and laboratory technicians is likely to bring services at over 604 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres to a grinding halt, inconveniencing hundreds of patients.   "On Saturday, some of them started feeling restless and uneasy. Some fainted and were then taken to the hospital. We have still not got any response from the government,'' Patil added.
