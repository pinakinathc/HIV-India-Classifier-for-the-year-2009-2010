  : Absence of nutritional supplements is an important cause for the fall in CD4 count in HIV/AIDS patients making them dependent on ART drugs and forcing them to suffer their side-effects. A campaign for supply of supplements at ART centres has been on since last year.   Meanwhile, the Bangalore HIV and AIDS Forum through individual and organisation support is distributing food packets on two days a week at ART centres at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital.   Chandrika from the organisation Milana told mediapersons on Thursday: "Health is everyone's right and we're only demanding our rights." Meena from the Forum demanded the state government issue BPL cards for HIV/ AIDS patients.   A Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society study showed that providing macro- and micro-nutrients to people living with HIV and AIDS improves their health and quality of life.   "Some states in the North provide free travel pass for HIV/AIDS patients and in Tamil Nadu they are supported with nutritional supplement supply," said Chandrika.
