    The occasion was the 26th International AIDS Candlelight Memorial, organised by Heroes Project, under the aegis of National AIDS Control Organisation and in association with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS). Paying homage to those who have lost their lives to the deadly disease were a number of well-known public figures along with organisations working towards the cause.   Thousands of Mumbaikars lit candles to show their solidarity. Hrithik Roshan, who was present along with wife Sussanne, encouraged everyone to work together to end the stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV. Dr K Sujatha Rao, Kumaramangalam Birla, Farhan Akhtar, Nandita Das, Shobhaa De, Tina Parekh and Parmeshwar Godrej who helped put the evening together, along with her husband Adi Godrej and daughters Tanya Dubash and Nisa Godrej, were some of the other people in the audience.   Even though Javed Akhtar could not be present, Farhan recited a special poem penned by his father for the occasion. Shobhaa too read out an emotional passage from her book. Nandita went on to describe the plight of the affected. Parmeshwar's grandchildren, Aryaan and Azaar, accompanied HIV-inflicted children on to the stage and urged the audience to support them in a powerful statement against stigma and discrimination.   Vikram Hazra performed evocative bhajans while Gayatri Ganjawala sang an anthem that exhorted people to overcome the stigma. A two minute silence was then observed to honour those who have passed on because of AIDS.
