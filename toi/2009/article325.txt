 PANAJI: Goa records an average of three cases of HIV every day, which has stonewashed government's effort to control this infection, a senior official said here today.   "Goa records one thousand new cases (of HIV) every year which means on an average three cases a day, which is alarming," Pradeep Padwal Director Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) said at a function organised by an NGO here.   Padwal, who heads the government body to control the spread of HIV, said the efforts are not targeted towards vulnerable groups like youths.   "The environment in Goa is such that youths are falling to lust of sex," he said.   About 98% of the HIV infections take place in Goa due to unsafe and unprotected sexual behaviour, he added.   There is no case of person getting HIV due to intravenous injection in the state, Padwal claimed.   The state has officially recorded 16,000 people living with HIV.   Padwal said that the recent judgements decriminalising homosexual relationships and Supreme Court's inclination towards legalising sex workers will go a long way in controlling the disease.   "Prevention is the only solution and people working in HIV field will be able to reach out to these groups in a better way now," he said.
