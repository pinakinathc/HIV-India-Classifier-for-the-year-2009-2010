 British health charities have condemned an advertisement which shows Adolf Hitler having unprotected sex, saying it stigmatises people infected with the virus.   The provocative commercial, which ends with the tag-line "AIDS is a mass murder", aims to young scare people into using condoms by associating the deadly disease with the German dictator, the Daily Telegraph reported.   In the highly-sexualised clip, a couple undress and begin to make love in a dimly-lit bedroom. But what appears to be a typical, if steamy, advert for perfume or underwear takes a macabre twist when the camera pans to man's face at the moment of climax â€” revealing him to be Adolf Hitler.   The commercial has been released to coincide with 2009 World AIDS Day, but established HIV/AIDS charities have distanced themselves from its message, saying that it could make life more difficult for sufferers.   "This advertisement has absolutely nothing to do with us or World AIDS Day campaigns in UK, which we coordinate," a spokeswoman for the National AIDS Trust said. "Nor does it have anything to do with World AIDS Campaign who coordinate international campaigns and this year are focusing on human rights of people living with HIV.   "The advert is stigmatising to people living with HIV who already face much stigma and discrimination due to ignorance about the virus. On top of this it fails to provide any kind of actual prevention message and may deter people to come forward for testing", the spokeswoman said.   It also features poster adverts showing other naked tyrants Saddam Hussein and Joseph Stalin spreading the infection.
