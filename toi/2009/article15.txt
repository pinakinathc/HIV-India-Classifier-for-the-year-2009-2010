The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) will inaugurate a 10-bedded community care centre for HIV patients at Van Vihar Colony on Tonk Road on Friday. The centre will be connected to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at SMS Hospital and the HIV patients requiring nursing will be provided free services there. The only Aids community care centre in the city was located on Ajmer Road but was closed in October 2008 due to absence of foreign contribution.
