 MUMBAI: Out of a couple of dozen HIV-positive students in the care of Sevalaya, an NGO in Hasegaon village, Latur district, that cares for HIV-positive children, ten were admitted to the zilla parishad primary school.   Initially, there was support for Sevalaya's efforts. But soon after the academic session for the primary section began, the students' HIV status became a hot topic of discussion, not only in the school but also in the village.   The parents of 150 children in the school then decided they would not send their kids to class until the HIV-positive students were expelled. When the matter reached the district headquarters, education officer Vilas Joshi, along with a team of doctors, visited the village to pacify the agitated parents.   "We had several rounds of talks with the parents. We explained that their children would not get AIDS. However, there was no answer to one question: can the infection be passed on if an HIV-positive student bites another student? As the doctor couldn't provide an explanation, the parents decided to withdraw their children from the school,'' a senior official said.   Activists working for the welfare of the HIV-positive students were shocked by the approach of the education officer, who reportedly promised the parents that the HIV-positive students would be segregated. "At a juncture when we are treating HIV and non-HIV students on a par, Joshi's assurance is shocking. He must ensure that there's no discrimination,'' an activist said.   The villagers unanimously passed a resolution to withdraw their children from school if the HIV-positive students were not expelled.
