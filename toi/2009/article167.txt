 MUMBAI: Two years after defective HIV test kits were supplied to government testing centres, the Delhi high court has directed local AIDS bodies to retest persons who came in for HIV/AIDS checks at their centres between February 2007 and May 2007.   While 76,464 persons were tested in that period in Mumbai, the number of those who were affected is expected to be frighteningly high given that the same kits were supplied across five states including Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.   Saying the issue of `poor-quality kits' reflects the poor implementation of the HIV/AIDS control programme, senior doctors said re-testing of persons visiting government centres was near-impossible, especially as HIV-testing is done under strict confidentiality. Faulty kits put a question mark about the number of persons who missed an accurate diagnosis.   The Delhi HC case pertains to the quality of testing kits, a petition converted into a PIL in 2008 and the recent directives for re-testing were issued on May 25, 2009.   With the next hearing scheduled for August 12, local bodies like the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are seeking re-testing of persons. But officials from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) seemed clueless about any such directive. "I haven't heard of any such directive but re-testing at our centres is impossible,'' said a senior NACO official.   MDACS chief S Kudalkar said they had traced the names of around 33,572 persons across their centres in Mumbai. "It is those who tested negative in those three months who are a cause for worry. Since they aren't tested again, if their result is wrong, they could have missed appropriate treatment,'' he said.   Dr Alaka Deshpande who heads state-run JJ Hospital's AIDS centre said the use of faulty tests could also have led to pregnant mothers being missed, putting their child at a greater risk of acquiring the infection.
