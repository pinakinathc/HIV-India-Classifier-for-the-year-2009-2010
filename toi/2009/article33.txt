 A German AIDS patient was able to stop taking medication he had been taking for 10 years after getting a transplant of stem cells from a donor with a rare gene variant known to resist the deadly disease. The transplant also cured his leukemia, researchers reported.  The stem cell donor was among the 1% of Caucasians who have the variant gene lacking a section known as CCR5 that helps the AIDS virus enter a cell, according to a report on Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine report.  People who inherit one copy of CCR5 delta32 take longer to get  sick or develop AIDS if infected with HIV. People with two copies (one from each parent) may not become infected at all. The stem cell donor had two copies. Doctors in Berlin hoped that putting the donor's stem cells in the patient would rebuild his immune system and blood cells such that they would lack the CCR5 piece.  While promising, the treatment is unlikely to help the vast majority of people infected with HIV, said Jay Levy, a professor at the University of California San Francisco. A stem cell transplant is too extreme and too dangerous to be used as a routine treatment, he said. However, less invasive options to alter CCR5 could be on the horizon within the next five years, said Levy.
