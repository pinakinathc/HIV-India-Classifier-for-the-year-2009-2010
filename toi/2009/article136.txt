 BELGAUM: District surgeon Dr Ashok Murgod called upon the members of self-help groups (SHGs) to spread awareness about HIV among their family members, which in turn may help others also be aware about the deadly disease.   Speaking after inaugurating a workshop at the District Training Institute here on Monday, the surgeon said: "Contrary to general belief, AIDS does not mean immediate death. Even if a person is having HIV, he or she can live up to 15 to 20 years. Showing them love and affection can make them live much longer."   He went on to explain the services for the HIV-afflicted at the district hospital like counselling, treatment and free medicines.   The workshop was jointly organized by district health and family welfare department, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), and BIRDS (Naganur).   Prabakar Karyakar, in-charge principal of district training centre, said: "Polio, which was a dreaded disease earlier, is now under control, thanks to the noble service rendered by SHGs. HIV will not spread by touching, sharing clothes, having food together," he said.   DAPCU's Dr V B Kulkarni highlighted the importance of good co-ordination between all the government departments to check the spread of HIV.   "National AIDS Control Organization has drawn up plans to contain the disease by decentralizing its administration. We plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halting and reversing the epidemic in the near future," he added.
