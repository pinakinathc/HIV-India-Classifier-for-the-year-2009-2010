 GURGAON: It was a confession that shook even the most hardened law-keepers. Naresh (name changed), the accused in the triple murders in Shikohpur village near Gurgaon, said he killed his wife and two minor children because he feared they were suffering from AIDS. Naresh was arrested last week. He remained in police remand for three days and was produced in court on Tuesday.   On December 16, 2008, Naresh allegedly killed his 27-year-old wife, seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son by strangulating them at home, 14 km away from Gurgaon. Police registered a case under section 302 of IPC against Naresh, his father and brother after Naresh's father-in-law implicated the trio. Though his brother and father were arrested immediately, Naresh went absconding. He was arrested later from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, said the SHO of Kherki Daula police station.   "During interrogation Naresh said that after his marriage, he fell into bad company and started visiting sex workers. He regularly went to GB Road in Delhi. For the last few months he feared his liaison with multiple partners may have resulted in him contracting AIDS. Meanwhile, he met a tantrik who told him that he will die soon. This only reinforced his doubts," said Narrotam Prasad, investigating officer.   "He started believing his wife and children had also become HIV positive. This led him to take the extreme step. He wanted to kill himself also after committing the crime, but could not gather the courage," Prasad added.   Naresh's father-in-law had claimed that the accused was an alchoholic who often beat his wife.
