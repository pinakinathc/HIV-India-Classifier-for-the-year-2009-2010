 CHENNAI: To mark International Women's Day, World Vision and the Indian Network for People living with HIV/AIDS (IPL+) organized a public hearing on Tuesday to highlight the problems faced by women, especially those living with HIV/AIDS.   Seven issues from districts such as Tuticorn, Sivakasi and Chennai were discussed. The panellists, including lawyers, a doctor, college professor, a journalist and an activist, stressed the need for public-private partnerships to generate job opportunities for women.   Daisy David, networking co-ordinator, public engagement department of World Vision, said: "Corporates should join hands with government agencies to come forward to provide jobs for women. Providing sewing machines to such women in urban areas is not going to be of any help because every street has a tailor in cities such as Chennai. Moreover many can only do light work because of their medical condition. All these should be kept in mind while thinking of livelihood options for affected women."   The speakers mentioned the need for comprehensive and care-support programmes for the affected children. Dr Bimal Charles, project director of the AIDS Prevention and Control Project, Chennai, who inaugurated the event, said: "According to a UNAIDS survey, women in the 15-24 age group do not have adequate access to information regarding HIV/AIDS. This makes them vulnerable to contracting the infection. And women do not have proper access to care resulting in more complications."   World Vision and IPL+ have decided to coordinate with other NGOs in the state to start legal fora in various districts to address issues faced by women and children affected by HIV/AIDS.
