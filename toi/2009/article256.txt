 CHANDIGARH: Reacting to the move of terminating the services of HIV positive people employed as outreach workers with 72 counselling centres of State AIDS Control Society (SACS) across the country, the Network of Positive People (NPP) is in the process of filing a PIL to contest the same.   Voicing resentment against National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Pooja Thakur, president, NPP-Chandigarh, said, 'The organization cannot all of a sudden outsource placement to any agency without waiting for completion of the contract period of a year.'   The city has seven such employees who were taken up as counsellors by NACO six months ago. According to legal experts, any breach of contract can be contested for compensation.   As Amar Vivek, advocate, Punjab and Haryana High Court noted, 'These people can legally fight the case... and none can expel them before the contract is over.'   While NPP and affected employees will also be writing to NACO, Thakur said, 'We are not interested in who takes over the agency for recruiting outreach workers. Anyone can hire but they should comply with the terms and conditions of the contract.'   Though Vanita Gupta, director, SACS, Chandigarh, said they would make all efforts to retain efficient workers, HIV positive Anshu (name changed) said, 'I am apprehensive about any government control remaining after a private agency gets the project.'
