 BELGAUM: "HIV does not mean death sentence any more. It's just a chronic disease that can be managed by proper treatment which is available free of cost in every district," said Dr VB Kulkarni, officer of District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU).   He was speaking at a blood donation and AIDS awareness camp jointly organized by NCC Karnataka Battalion CATC-4 and District Hospital here on Thursday. Around 600 NCC cadets and NSS volunteers from Dharwad and Hubli colleges attended the camp. Of them, 30 students donated blood.   Dr Kulkarni said anti-retroviral therapy is the only medicine that can prolong the life of HIV-affected persons. "Youth in 15-29 age group are vulnerable to HIV. DAPCU is focussing on Karnataka Adult Student Health Programme to free the society from diseases," he added.   The doctor advised the students to avoid pre-marital sex and be faithful to their partner after their marriage. "Proper use of contraceptives and drugs will help in the long run," he said.   Dr Chandrashekar Karadiguddi, TB nodal officer, and NSS officers Sadanand Murari were present. Population Services International played games to spread awareness on HIV.
