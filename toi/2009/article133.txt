 AHMEDABAD: Glowing tributes were paid to Major Rishikesh Ramani, who laid down his life fighting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, in tableaux at the 132 nd rath yatra on Wednesday.   Along with Major Ramani, plight of Indian students in Australia and Tata's entry into Gujarat with Nano dominated tableaux themes at the yatra.   While three tableau paid homage to the martyr from Ahmedabad, one demanded an Ashok Chakra and national honour for the hero. A tableaux demanded justice in the conman Ashok Jadeja case.   This year, 100 trucks took part in the rath yatra where the organisers try out new things to attract the viewers and entertain them. However, some use it as a creative platform to draw attention for a social cause. This time around, 96 trucks and tableaux were on display.   Most of the tableaux were on religious themes but some of them went on to put banners and slogans on AIDS and cancer awareness, anti-tobacco, female foeticide and environmental degradation.   One of the tableaux showed a model of Tata's Nano atop the truck with cut outs of Ratan Tata and Narendra Modi. The car had Jay Ranchhod Makhan Chor' written on the top and photos of Lord Krishna on both the sides.   Four of the tableaux were decorated with Major Ramani's pictures, couplets depicting his bravery and a demand for awarding him the Ashok Chakra. A tableau had models of cigarettes eating away the human body and warning against cancer. As many of the trucks had collaborated with Ahmedabad Medical Association, they had a board asking people to stay away from AIDS.
