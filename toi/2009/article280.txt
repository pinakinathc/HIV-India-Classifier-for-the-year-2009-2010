 NAGPUR: It's a story of how dreams come crashing down and how one rises from the ashes. Robin, a budding footballer of the city, who could have made amark nationally, had an abrupt end to his sporting career when he was diagnosed with HIV 10 years ago. The doctors had even 'fixed' his date of death as March 13, 2001. But the fighting spirit of sportsman in Robin made him not to give up and stretched his life into the extra time. Despite being bed-ridden, 29-year-old Robin wears a smile and optimism to emerge a winner.   After being deserted by his family, Robin, a Hislopian, finds his childhood friend Reena and her husband on his  side in fight against HIV. Robin was selected for Mohun Bagan and was undergoing a training camp in Delhi. During one of the sessions, Robin fainted and was taken to a hospital where he was tested HIV positive. He saw his world collapse. Robin is battling for a survival at ACCEPT Palliative Care Centre, Bangalore.   "I am partially blind and paralysed waist down... my spinal cord is damaged. My legs are too weak and I can't walk. But I will recuperate one day... thanks to Reena and her husband Rajiv who are spending Rs 2 lakh for my spinal surgery notwithstanding that I am in last stage," Robin said.   "I was in in love with Reena since standard 10. When I was in BCom second year and my football career was  taking shape, catastrophe struck. I convinced Reena to get married and settle down. That was 8 years ago when doctors 'predicted' about the last day of my life," he said adding that he contracted HIV through a physical relation.   (Some names have been changed to protect identity)
