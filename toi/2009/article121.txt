 LONDON: India opener Virender Sehwag, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara and South Africa skipper Graeme Smith will raise awareness about HIV as part of an ICC initiative which coincides with the World Twenty20 Championships, starting on Friday.   The campaign will feature messages and information to raise awareness about HIV among young people.   "I hope that people, and young people in particular, are educated about HIV and take the precautions they need," Sehwag said.   "Everyone deserves the chance to have the information they need to make the right choices and protect themselves, and their loved ones from HIV," he added.   Around 10 million people living with HIV are from major cricketing countries. This accounts for more than a quarter of all the people across the world who are HIV-positive.   The trio will be joined by Australian pacer Nathan Bracken and England's women's team player Isa Guha in the initiative.   Five new public service announcements (PSAs) featuring some of the players will be shown during the event on big screens at grounds, on the official event website as well as by broadcasters across the globe.
