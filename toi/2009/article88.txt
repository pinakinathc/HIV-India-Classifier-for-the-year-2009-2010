 BANGALORE: Lack of affordability of uncontaminated Anti-Haemophilic Factor (AHF) exposes patients of the blood disorder to the risk of contracting HIV and Hepatitis C.   According to Haemophilic Federation of India (HFI) vice-president Suresh Hanagawadi, 10% of haemophilics in India get infected with HIV, and more than 22% have contracted Hepatitis C.   "Realizing that they are innocent victims of AIDS, the National AIDS Control Organization ACO provided a one-time assistance of 2.5 million AHF two years ago. However, we've not received any assistance for the past one year," he said.   According to WHO statistics, one in every 10,000 suffers from haemophilia, It is more predominant in males -- one in every 5,000. There are at least 1 lakh haemophilics in India. The 25-year-old HFI has only 13,000 members. Almost 80% of the patients are yet to register with us, Suresh added.   The theme for this year's Haemophilia Day is `Together we care'. The federation has demanded comprehensive haemophilia care by making drugs more affordable.
