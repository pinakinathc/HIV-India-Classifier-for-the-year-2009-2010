 VADODARA: The city may well make it to Limca Book of Records and Guinness Book of World Records yet another time. A city-based education group's effort of spreading AIDS awareness in 10 days has seen success. The group reached out to over 3.71 lakh youngsters during the 10 days of Navratri to spread the message of AIDS prevention.   The group was aiming to break the world record of carrying out AIDS human awareness campaign through red ribbon. A Tamil Nadu-based NGO currently holds the record of reaching out to 2.97 lakh kids in seven districts in 10 days. While the Guinness Book of World Record is of a HIV campaign among 3,640 people in Germany.   "We have surpassed the record by a huge margin. We worked hard for it and our efforts have paid off. We are meeting Limca Book of Records officials on October 5 and then approach Guinness Book of World Records," said Sunil Dalwadi, chairperson of JC Group.   Over 250 volunteers, all students of Baroda Institute of Management Studies (BIMS), spread out to 23 garba venues. Red ribbons were tied on arms of Garba revellers and banners were kept at the venues. "Over 1.12 lakh persons were contacted at Maa Shakti Garba venue alone. Our volunteers ensured that people got full information about AIDS," said Shweta Upadyaya, the programme co-ordinator.   The city figures in the record books as a hotel employee had worked for three years without ever taking any leave.
