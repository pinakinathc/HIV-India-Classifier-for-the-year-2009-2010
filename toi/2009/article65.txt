  : HIV positive patients in Karnataka now have access to second-line drugs at an Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre in Bangalore. These are administered to patients who don't respond to first-line drugs. Since they are expensive and not available at ART centres, most patients can't take them.   These SLDs were available in Maharashtra and Chennai. Finally responding to the long-standing demand of AIDS patients, 10 ART centres of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) have access to SLDs, which cost Rs 7,000-8,000 per month per patient to the government.   In Karnataka, SLDs are available at Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore. They'll be given free of cost but only to those screened and selected by the state's AIDS clinical expert panel at the ART centre. There are plans to extend to other centres as per a NACO direction.   ART service was first initiated at this hospital as it has registered 7,450 HIV positive patients and 3,225 are on first-line drugs.   Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, dean and director, G T Subhash, said, "Five patients have been selected by the expert panel for second-line drugs. They are admitted to the hospital for 15 days to monitor drug reaction. Subsequently, the service will be extended to other ART centres in the state."
