This four day training would be conducted by the members of the Christian Medical Association.   Under this sensitisation programme 10 teams have been made to cover all the 70 district of Uttar Pradesh. Each team constituting of two members one qualified doctor and a volunteer. During the first two days of the TOT session these people would be informed about the the correct way of treating an HIV positive without getting infected and also breaking the age old taboos.  HIV positives should not be kept in isolation even for the treatment purpose, and should be kept in the same ward along with other patients without even infecting any. Later on the third day of the practical training they would be sent to various cities to spread the awareness and would finally come back on the fourth day after compiling all their data.   It might be recalled that this training session which is starting from February 10 and would be concluded on February 14 2009.
