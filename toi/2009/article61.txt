VADODARA: Surprising it may sound but the HIV positive 15-year-old girl, found dead with her sister and parents, who allegedly committed suicide here on Wednesday, had inaugurated the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at SSG Hospital in January. The girl and her four-year-old sister had inaugurated the centre on January 27 at a function that was attended by their parents and health officials. "The girl, who was diagnosed as HIV positive, was asked to inaugurate the centre that was started to treat AIDS and HIV patients. They were regular at our centre and living a normal life," said Manisha Salunke, president of AP+, an association of people living with AIDS/HIV. AP+, which works closely with ART centre, had organised the inaugural ceremony of the centre wherein the young girl was invited. "We wanted some HIV positive child to inaugurate it and hence the young girl and her sister were invited. The entire family was present at the function," ART centre sources said. "We don't think that the family took the extreme step owing to social stigma or for financial reasons. They had come to us for counselling a couple of weeks ago and didn't seem under any pressure," Salunke told TOI. Sources said the husband was an outreach worker of District Aids Control Programme Control Unit (DACPCU) for primary health centre (PHC). "He was working for DACPCU for the last four months where he used to counsel and educate HIV and AIDS patients. It is surprising that he took such a step," said a source. The HIV positive family, including husband, wife and the two daughters, were found dead at their residence in Makarpura. Police believe the couple consumed poison and also gave it to their children. "We are investigating. We have registered a case of murder against the couple for giving poison to their daughters," said LK Katara, Makarpura police inspector.
