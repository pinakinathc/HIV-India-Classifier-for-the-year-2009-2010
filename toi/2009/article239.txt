 MYSORE: Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) has gone traditional to create awareness about HIV among the masses in the state.   The society, which believes that folk is an effective medium to convey the message, has chipped in folk artistes to educate people about HIV. As part of its initiative, artistes practising different form of folk art are being trained in Mysore. Harikatha, jogi pada, veragase, street play, karapala mela, beesu kamsale, dollu kunitha, puppetry and Yakshagana artistes from eight different districts are participating in the three-day orientation-cum-workshop programme, which kicked off on Tuesday.   KSAPS project director R R Jannu said at the workshop, the artistes will be taught about the messages to be conveyed through respective art forms. They will provide information about facilities available for affected persons, about treatment and awareness on how it spreads. Besides, there are many misconceptions about AIDS among people and we endeavour to clear doubts of people through the programme.   After the training, the artistes will be assigned particular places across the state. The society has planned to conduct 100 shows in every district of Karnataka from November-March 2010. The campaign will be intensified in red alert zones, Jannu stated.   Jogi pada artiste, K Guddappa Jogi (53) of Kaala Bhyrava jogi folk troupe from Shimoga, says folk media plays a crucial role in creating awareness of national/state programmes particularly in rural parts. Street play artiste Shankar of Ragaranjini kalathanda from Mandya said they feel happy that art is being used for a cause.
