MUMBAI: Seventy-seven prisoners in central jails across the state have tested positive for HIV, the Bombay high court was told recently. The report of the first survey of the prevalence of HIV among prisoners was conducted by an HC-appointed committee between October 2008 and February 2009.Experts, however, say the number could be deceptive as not all the prisoners were tested for the virus; of the 9,830 incarcerated in the four central jails at Thane, Pune, Amravati and Nashik, only 2,787 had taken the test. With 77 prisoners testing positive, the prevalence is a high 2.76%, the national average being less than 1%. The Nashik prison recorded the highest number, with the figure touching 25.The two-member panel of Dr Alka Deshpande from J J Hospital and Prakash Sabde, ex-project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, have recommended a series of measures to check the rising number of HIV cases. One of the suggestions is to screen every new prisoner for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The panel has also sought setting up of integrated counselling and testing centres at jails. The other measures include providing anti-retroviral treatment, conducting awareness drives and training prison medical officers and nurses. The panel has also asked the authorities to work with NGOs so that follow-up treatment can be ensured to HIV-positive prisoners released from jails.A division bench of CJ Swatanter Kumar and Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud have asked the state to implement the recommendations.
