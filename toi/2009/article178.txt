 CHENNAI: Two days after a woman dragged the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) to court for having used her photo and that of her daughter without consent, the Madras HC on Wednesday pulled up the AIDS body and directed it to remove all banners featuring the photo within a week.   Justice K Suguna, before whom the matter came up for admission, also permitted the petitioner's counsel, G Mohanakrishnan, to implead Sasi Advertising Agency in the case. The woman and her daughter have sought compensation of Rs 1 crore from Tansacs.
