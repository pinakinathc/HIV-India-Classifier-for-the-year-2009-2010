 NEW DELHI: A crucial finding by clinicians in Mexico, the country where the deadly H1N1 flu virus originated, could have India worried.   Initial observations made by the WHO, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mexican clinicians who studied the first 40 deaths in Mexico show that people with underlying conditions like asthma, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), immunosuppressive illnesses like HIV, diabetes and TB appear to be at greater risk of hospitalisation or death if infected with H1N1.   India, which is yet to report a positive H1N1 infection, and is presently testing the throat sample of a Jet Airways ground staff in Delhi for H1N1 infection, has the dubious distinction of having the largest number of people with such illnesses. India diagnoses 1.8 million new cases of TB every year with 370,000 deaths.   The country is home to 2.35 million HIV positive people and has 15 million asthmatics. CVDs have become the leading cause of death with heart attacks projected to kill 2 million by 2010.   Even though experts said the finding was preliminary, they agreed that a few trends had begun to emerge. V M Katoch, ICMR's director general said, "People with HIV, TB and CVDs are in high risk group. Outbreak of H1N1 could pose a problem. They have to be better looked after in case of a positive infection."   Sylvie Briand, project leader of WHO's global Influenza Programme, said, "We reviewed all the severe cases that Mexico had and were able to differentiate two types of people that are at risk of severe illness. One group had who got sick and experienced rapid deterioration of their health with most of them having died of acute viral pneumonia. The second group had people with chronic underlying conditions such as diabetes, TB, cardiovascular diseases. In these people, viral pneumonia progressed into acute respiratory distress. So they died mostly of respiratory and major organ failure."
