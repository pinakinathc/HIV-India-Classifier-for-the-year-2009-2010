 PANAJI: Although Goa's ambitious plan to have mandatory pre-marriage HIV testing is kept on the backburner, the state has seen considerable rise in the number of people voluntarily opting for HIV test.   "There was almost 20 per cent rise in the people getting themselves tested at various integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC)," Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) Project Director Dr Pradeep Padwal said.   As against 22,917 blood samples tested in the year 2007, the year 2008 witnessed 26,737 people testing for the HIV positive status.   Dr Padwal said that the state government's ICTC units spread across the state has become an easy access point for those intending to check themselves.   Goa government, two years back, had mooted the plan to have compulsory pre-marriage HIV testing, which was scuttled following opposition by various groups including the Church.   The GSACS, state government funded body, has now initiated an extensive awareness drive involving NGOs asking people to check their status.   Dr Padwal said that in the year 2007, 1094 people were tested positive while in 2008, the number was reduced to 1018.
