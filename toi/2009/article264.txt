Likewise, 75.7% said sexual transmission could be avoided through correct use of condoms, while 73% stated use of disposable syringes and needles should be avoided.A majority of respondents belonged to the middle and upper class.Meanwhile, amongst 260 respondents, 193 (74.2%) were in the age group of 45-54 years, 50 (19.2%) were less than 45 years, 72.3% respondents belonged to the middle class, while 72 (27%) were from the upper strata of society.The study also found that 218 (83.5%) participants knew that HIV/AIDS was a sexually transmitted disease, while 66% knew it was caused by HIV virus.
