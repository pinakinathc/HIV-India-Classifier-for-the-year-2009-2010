 IMPHAL: Khundrakpam Pradipkumar has once again scripted a positive story. The 40-year-old HIV-positive muscleman from Manipur bagged a bronze in the 9th All-India inter-state body-building championship in the 55-kg category in Trichur on Sunday night.   "I would have been much happier had I won the gold. But I am not heartbroken. I will work harder to win the Mr India championship to be held in April in West Bengal," Pradip told TOI from Trichur.   "I have proved that one can achieve everything through hard work and determination. My award is dedicated to all those HIV positive people who have always been stigmatized," said the diminutive body-builder from Khamnam Leirak.   "I owe a lot to my friend Momtomba Singh, the Mr Manipur 2008. He had always guided me. Besides, my family has been a guiding force and has arranged funds for my diet," he added.   "My son called me up after winning the bronze. I am very proud of him. We encourage him in whatever he wants to do in life," said a cheerful Mema Devi, mother of Pradip Kumar.   Pradip tested positive eight years ago and disclosed his status after winning the senior Mr Manipur title in the 60-kg category in Imphal in December 2007.   The following year, he finished sixth in the national competition in Meerut. A film based on his life, Mr Manipur, produced and directed by Aribam Syam Sharma, was screened at the annual MIAAC Film Festival in November 2008 in New York.   The Manipur Aids Control Society has selected Pradip as its brand ambassador to fight the scourge of HIV/AIDS in the state, which has over 30,000 HIV positive people, including 8,000 women. Incidentally, Manipur is one of the six states in the country which has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
