 PATNA: The Patna High Court on Friday directed the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) to state what steps should be taken up by the Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) in view of alarming rise in the number of HIV+ cases in the state.   The order was passed on a PIL of Alok Kumar Sinha who submitted that only 27 cases of HIV positive were detected in the state in 2002 while the number of such cases has gone up to 23,000 now.   The court said NACO, BSACS and NGOs need to make joint efforts to control Aids in the state. Advocate general P K Shahi said the matter is serious and he would take instructions from the state officials concerned in this regard.   The petitioner alleged financial irregularities and lack of willpower on the part of authorities to fill up vacant posts in BSACS as the causes of rise in HIV+ cases in the state.
