 ALLAHABAD: District health authorities on Thursday conducted the orientation of as many as 500 inmates at Naini central jail and apprised them about factors behind spreading HIV and aids.   Ironically, when health department team led by Dr Meesum Sam, assistant district programme officer, AIDS control asked inmates that whether they were acquainted with HIV or AIDS, none of them could answer. Inmates aged between 22 and 35 years told doctors that they had never heard the words like HIV and AIDS.   Dr Meesum told TOI that health authorities have told inmates that commercial female sex workers, men having sex with men and intra-drug users can spread HIV\AIDS if they are HIV positive. People should be cautious and alert and should opt for protected means when visiting these people.   Apart from orientation, health department officials also conducted Focus Group Discussion (FGD) among six HIV positive inmates living at Naini central jail. Dr Meesum also added that as many as 11 samples have also been collected from Meerganj locality of the city as health authorities were checking the current status of HIV and AIDS victims in city.   He claimed that only one commercial female sex worker was found HIV positive till last month and she was treated at ART centre in the city. He also claimed that the department was utilising all resources for addressing the HIV\Aids menace.   All the seven organisations including NGOs are implementing TI (targeted interventions) among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), Men Having Sex with Men (MSM) and IDUs (Intra-drug users).   Meanwhile, Dr VK Srivastava, district programme officer, AIDS control said, "Effective measures are being taken to achieve the desired results." He added that officials were stressing more on educational and awareness campaigns.
