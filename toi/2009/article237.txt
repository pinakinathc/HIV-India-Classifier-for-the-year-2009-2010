      The report suggest HAART regimens should be initiated as early as possible in eligible mothers in areas with limited resources, such as Africa, where most infant HIV-1 infections occur, and breastfeeding is common.
      
      
      Researchers studied 2,318 infant/mother pairs in Malawi to come up with their conclusions and suggest that HAART regimens should be administered as soon as possible to mothers, especially in underdeveloped countries.
      
      
      The author���s however, note that women who cannot take HAART due to a high CD4 count, the choices are not very definite. CD4 is a primary receptor used by HIV-1 tyo enter into host T cells.
      
      
      Speaking about the research, Grace C. John-Stewart of the University of Washington School of Public Health, writes: "Recognizing the impact of prompt HAART initiation in eligible women and finding efficiencies in CD4 testing and delivery of HAART services will leverage antenatal HIV-1 testing to increase maternal survival and decrease infant infections."
