 AHMEDABAD: In a major relief to HIV AIDS patients, health minister Jaynarayan Vyas has announced that patients would be given free travel and reimburse them for visiting hospitals for anti retro-viral therapy (ART).   On the eve of World AIDS Day on Monday, Vyas said in case of children receiving ART treatment, the person accompanying the child would be given Rs 100 as compensation for loss of wages. This has been done to ensure 95 per cent regularity in treatment. The state government would spend nearly Rs 2 crore on the project.   Originally the suggestion had come from the Gujarat Network of Positive People (GNPPLus). The Rs 500 allowance, which was given to tuberculosis and cancer patients was given only to those HIV patients belonging to the schedule caste and schedule tribe and other backward class people. Now, the government is considering extending this help to all patients suffering from HIV.   Vyas said the state government has also begun research on side-effects of ART drugs. The results would be available in two years. He also announced that the Red Ribbon Express will enter Gujarat from December 20 and be in the state till January 3, 2010. The train would stay in Ahmedabad for three days.      * In 2009-10, 8,972 new HIV positive cases detected in state   * 2,66130 persons tested till October 2009   * Annual detection increases from 6,998 in 2005-06 to 14,670 in 2008-09   * State government to start 8 new ART centres   * 12 Link ART centres will be started by year-end   * 2,20,912 pregnant women tested for HIV   * 34,800 given benefits of HIV care and treatment   * 19,180 given free drugs   * Gujarat first in implementing structured rural HIV/AIDS program
