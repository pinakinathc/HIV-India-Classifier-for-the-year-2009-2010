 MUMBAI: The HINI virus is keeping the medical board of Pune's Sassoon Hospital so busy that they apparently do not have the time to treat a critical HIV patient.   When the Bombay high court was told on Friday that the medical board was "preoccupied with the swine flu epidemic'' and could attend to a seriously- ailing HIV positive convict only next Tuesday, the judges directed the convict's release on bail. A bond of Rs 10,000 was paid for his release.   Vivek Padwal, a 39-year-old murder convict from Pune serving a life sentence since October, had applied for bail on the grounds that he was not receiving any treatment at the Pune hospital despite court directions. A bench headed by Justice B H Marlapalle on Friday said, "It was clear that despite being taken to Sassoon Hospital for five-six days in the recent past, he could not be examined by the medical board. His condition is serious.'' Padwal's lawyer Rajesh Bindra said his CDR count was very high and his condition was critical. Pleading that if he was not treated at a proper hospital he would die earlier, Padwal had added that three such convicts had faced a similar fate due to the lack of treatment.   Padwal was held guilty of murdering another Pune resident, Mayur Damle, following a fight over Damle flinging an empty liqour bottle into his house in 2007. Padwal's wife Poornima and his mother were present in HC to plead that they would take care of him at home, fund his treatment and take him regularly to the police station. The prosecutor also said the ART centre at Sassoon government hospital was the only centre for such treatment where he would be taken. With these assurances, Justice Marlapalle's bench was convinced that he ought to be released on a bail bond of Rs 10,000 to ensure prompt medical attention in the interest of justice.   Padwal's mother said, "I am happy to have my son home again after two-and-a- half years. I shall take care of him.''
