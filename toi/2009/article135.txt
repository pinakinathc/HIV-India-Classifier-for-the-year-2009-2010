 CHENNAI: Though people living with HIV/AIDS have life insurance in western countries such as the US, such people in India are denied the right. Drawing attention to the stigma associated with people living with AIDS, speakers at a daylong workshop in the city asked government and insurance companies to provide health cover to HIV-positive people.   "Due to the successful use of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV/AIDS are able to live longer while maintaining a higher quality of life. Out of an estimated 2.5 lakh people living in the state with AIDS, nearly 40,000 use ART. After the opening of the insurance sector, nearly 22 companies in India provide life insurance service. It is regrettable, however, that not a single one of them has come forward to provide cover for the people living with AIDS," said the managing trustee of Genesis Welfare Trust, P Thangathurai, who organised the workshop.   "A debate continues among activists about how insurance should be offered to people living with AIDS. These people are not beggars. They want to live with dignity and self-respect. However, a subsidy can be provided while providing them life insurance," said Dr Bimal Roy, project director, Aids Prevention and Control (APAC) project. Dr Roy urged organizers of the workshop to prepare a report so that the debate on the issue could be taken forward.   A recent study conducted by APAC among 667 people living with the disease across 10 districts in Tamil Nadu revealed that they were willing to pay premium for health insurance but preferred subsidised private healthcare instead of government intervention, said Prathiba, a researcher at APAC. The was a need to lobby with government and the insurance sector to ensure that people living with HIV/AIDS in the country had access to life and health insurance, experts said.
