LUDHIANA: Now people living in the rural areas need not come to the city civil hospital for HIV-testing, as primary health centres (PHCs) will soon start five integrated testing and counselling centres in the district.A proposal in this regard has already been sent by the National Aids Control Organization to the district health department. According to information, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is working on a three phase project. While the first phase aims to create awareness, the second aims to set up an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and ICTC centres.Already 57 integrated counselling and testing centres are functional in the district and NACO has initiated the project for people residing in rural areas.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a staff member of ICTC centre at the civil hospital, said, "Around 75% cases coming to the hospital are referred and only 25% come voluntarily." He said any person, wanting to know about his or her HIV status, could get themselves tested at the ICTC centre and remove misconceptions about the disease. Meanwhile, talking to The TOI, Dr Geetika, District Aids Control Programme Officer, said, "The proposal was sent by NACO to start integrated counselling centres at the primary health centres, which function for 24 hours.She said some of the identified PHCS included PHC at Laddowal, Hathoor, Delon, Sanewaal and Kumkalan, where it is expected that the lab testing equipment would be installed soon, while rest of the PHCS would manage on their own.She further said if people got themselves tested at the centres, it would help the department get a fair idea of how many people were infected with HIV.Meanwhile, about 8.63% HIV positive cases had been registered at the ICTC, while over 1,355 persons had been tested till September, 2007, out of which, 316 cases had reported positive.
