MUMBAI: A month after Goregaon (E) resident Firdos Sagar was given a report erroneously labelling her as HIV-positive at civic-run M W Desai Hospital, the apex AIDS body--Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS)--has transferred two staffers and issued them warning memos.TOI reported on Wednesday how a Goregaon couple had complained to various agencies after mother-of-two Firdos had a miscarriage allegedly because of the trauma she underwent after she was handed an HIV-positive report. Two subsequent tests at other hospitals showed she was HIV-negative.AIDS chief S Kudalkar told TOI on Thursday that the agency had taken a strong note of the incident and passed instructions to all testing and counselling centres to strictly follow counselling guidelines. "Lab technician Sheetal Salve and counsellor Raju Choure were issued warning memos and transferred out of the hospital as they were wrong,'' said Kudalkar.It now emerges that Firdos had gone for the test as part of a procedure for medical termination of pregnancy. Her husband, Naazim, said he had raked up the issue only because he didn't want anyone else to suffer the agony that he and his wife went through because of a wrong report.
