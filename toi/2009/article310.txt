 BANGALORE: Here is some good news on World AIDS Day: the incidence of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) has declined from 1.5% to 0.86% in Karnataka.   Speaking at `HIV/AIDS: An Interaction With Media Leaders', health and family welfare commissioner D N Nayak said: "AIDS is more a social issue than a health problem. Karnataka is the third high-risk state, but the incidence of infections have significantly declined.''   Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) project director R R Jannu said: "In 2003, ante-natal attendance was 1.5%, but today, it is 0.86%. And, there is a significant decline in the disease in women under 25 years. But HIV-positive cases, which were concentrated in North Karnataka districts, are now distributed equally in the southern districts.''   Kasinath from UNAIDS said: "The UN General Assembly has declared universal access for HIV/AIDS treatment by 2010."   According to Sowmya, who represented the sexual minorities community, "HIV/AIDS patients suffer from stigma and discrimination from the public, police and local goondas. This must stop.''   Helen, a representative of the sex workers' community, felt that "apart from awareness, there is a need to empower the community through providing access to health facilities and education for our children''.      * 33 million people affected by HIV/AIDS   * Of them, 50% are women   * 2 million die of it every year      * 2.4 million people affected by the disease   * Of them, 8.8 lakh are women, 1.4 million are men, 1.15 lakh are infants and kids   * Many children live with the disease   * HIV epidemic high prevalence in: Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland   * NACO budget for 2007-2011 is US$2.5 billion, 60% of funds allocated for prevention   * HIV and AIDS highest in 15-49 age group      * 2.45 lakh live with HIV   * NACO allocated Rs 5,335 lakh for KSAPS for prevention, treatment and support activities   * There are 33 ART centres and 30 link ART centres   * Total of 112,495 PLHIV are on ART, of them 2,722 are children      * Female sex workers, their clients and truck drivers: 5.83%   * Homosexuals - MSM: 2%   * Injecting drug users: 17.6%   * Infants of mothers with HIV: 8,942
