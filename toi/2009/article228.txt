 CHENNAI: In a gesture of care and support to its employees with HIV/AIDS, the Tamil Nadu government has decided to give 18 months paid medical leave to those infected by the virus.   A government order issued by the department of personnel and administrative on Friday said the state was the first in the country to extend such a benefit. It directed all departments to sanction leave to HIV-infected persons without any hesitation.   In 2007, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society had recommended that people infected with HIV/AIDS be given leave without hesitation. "People with HIV/AIDS often fall sick as their immunity levels are low. We don't have exact numbers of people with the infection in the government sector. We wanted to set an example to several employers who ask infected people to quit fearing their productivity would go down.   So, we recommended that the infection be included along with other diseases like TB, cancer and leprosy where leave is given with salary for 18 months. All the department heads would require is a medical certificate mentioning the HIV positive status of the employee,'' said health secretary V K Subburaj.
