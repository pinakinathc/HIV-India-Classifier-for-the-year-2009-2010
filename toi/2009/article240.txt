 DARBHANGA: A sudden increase in the number of HIV positive pregnant women reaching the gynaecology department of Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) for delivery this month indicates the presence of a large number of HIV infected women in Darbhanga district.   DMCH superintendent Dr Suraj Nayak told TOI on Friday that earlier only two to three HIV infected women use to come to DMCH for delivery every month but in October this year 11 women had already visited DMCH for delivery. While seven women had delivered children normally, the remaining four had to undergo Caesarean section. "DMCH had sufficient number of HIV protective kits for use by doctors. Hence there was no problem in handling such cases at the hospital," Dr Nayak said.   However, he had been receiving reports that sometimes Grade IV staff and some nurses of the gynaecology department discourage the attendants of such patients from admitting their wards in the hospital on one pretext or the other. Hence, he had notified that anybody found indulging in such practice would be severely dealt with.   Dr Raj Arora, resident surgeon in the gynaecology department, performed Caesarean section on the HIV infected women. Dr Nayak further said at the anti-retroviral treatment centre, which has been functional at DMCH for the past year, more than 1,600 HIV patients had been registered for treatment so far. This was also indicative of the presence of a large number of HIV patients in this area.
