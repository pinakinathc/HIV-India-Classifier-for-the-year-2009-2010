 LUCKNOW: The psychology students at Lucknow University are busy with compiling entries and preparing invites. Their effort is aimed towards bringing maximum students from other departments to share a social responsibility -- AIDS awareness and sensitisation.   It will be out on December 1 - the World AIDS Day - if they have been successful in their endeavour. On the day, the university will organise a series of socially relevant activities like blood donation camps, inauguration of a counselling cell and competition for students. The prominent of all would be the inauguration of the university's Red Ribbon Club (RRC) on the directions of the state government.   "All universities and colleges have to set up their Red Ribbon Clubs and we too have been told to do the same by the government," said Prof Archana Shukla, co-ordinator, RRC, Lucknow University. Department of psychology has been entrusted with the responsibility to oversee and co-ordinate the setting up of RRC. Reason being that the department is already working for a Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) project.   The RRC will comprise students and teachers from LU, colleges and schools. It will sensitise and counsel youth, who are at greater risk of catching HIV, both on campuses as well as in the society. "RRC members will help in implementing and facilitating the programmes of the club," said Ashutosh Srivastava, zonal project manager for GFATM, Lucknow University.   The RRC programme will address the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of youth in the inter-related areas of both HIV/AIDS and sexuality, as demanded by their age, environment and lifestyle all along.   To make December 1 event successful, preparations at the university are already underway. "We still have time for others to come and join us," said Pooja Pandey, a student. November 23 is the last date for receiving entries.
