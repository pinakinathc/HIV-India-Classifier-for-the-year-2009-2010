 BANGALORE: The number of research efforts on finding a drug to cure HIV is far greater than those on any other virus. This was revealed at a conference and workshop on `HIV/AIDS palliative care' at IAF Command Hospital on Thursday.   "The only intervention so far that has produced results, and closely resembles the role of a vaccine, is male circumcision. I'm optimistic that with the pace of ongoing research, a vaccine can be developed and we can deliver a major blow to AIDS," said Lt. general Raghunath, former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS).   According to chief medical officer of YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, N Kumaraswamy, administering anti-retroviral drug to all AIDS patients may control the deadly disease.   "In the absence of a cure for HIV, people suffer from a host of infections such as tuberculosis. This is where palliative care comes in and plays a significant role in the treatment process."   Air Vice-Marshal Anil Behl participated in the event. The three-day conference was organized jointly with the United States Pacific Naval Command and AFMS.
