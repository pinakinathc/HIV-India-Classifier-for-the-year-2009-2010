      a prime target of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV ��� than any other part of the male foreskin. Because this would make the inner foreskin more susceptible to HIV, removing it through circumcision would help lower a man's risk of contracting HIV, they concluded.
      
      
      In the second study, a two-year study of nearly 3,000 Kenyan men found that those who were recently circumcised were less likely to suffer coital injuries, such as scratches, cuts, scrapes or soreness, than those who had their foreskin intact. Sexual function was determined to be similar between the circumcised and uncircumcised groups, according to the research team, which was from the United States, Canada and Africa.
      
      
      "These are important reports which support the concepts that circumcision does not interfere with sexual function and it is an important element of HIV  in sub-Saharan Africa," association spokesman Dr. Ira D. Sharlip said in a news release issued by the organization.
      
      
      "At the same time, it should be emphasized that circumcision must be combined with other techniques of HIV prevention, such as safe sex and voluntary testing," he said. "It is not sufficient to rely on circumcision alone to prevent HIV transmission."
