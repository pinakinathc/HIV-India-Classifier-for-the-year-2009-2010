 JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court has directed the state government to take immediate steps for the treatment of a jail inmate who is suffering form AIDS.   Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma directed the state authorities to consult SMS Hospital as well as AIIMS, New Delhi and provide the best medical attention to the prisoner who is presently lodged in Central Jail, Alwar.   The prisoner had filed an application before the court for suspension of his punishment on grounds of his ailment. He pleaded that his wife also died due to AIDS and that he has four kids to be looked after.   The prisoner is undergoing punishment for commiting rape.   Justice Sharma while rejecting his application for suspension of sentence on the basis of the ailment, directed secretary (jails), department of home affairs, to provide treatment to the prisoner under his supervision and knowledge.   The court also granted meeting rights to the kids of the prisoner which were otherwise restricted as per the jail manual.   "Since the applicant has submitted that his wife has died due to AIDS and that he has four kids and that his financial condition is miserable, it is, therefore, directed that the superintendent, Alwar Central Jail shall after due consultation with the medical officer make arrangements for the meeting of the children of the prisoner. It is further directed that the superintendent shall make necessary and proper arrangements for the prescribed medication and proper diet of the prisoner," said Justice Sharma.   "It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court has held in the case of Sunil Batra, a prisoner then lodged in Tihar Jail, that merely by conviction a human being does not cease to be a human and he cannot be said to have a mere animal existence even in the jail. The right to life under the Constitution does not mean a mere animal existence and right to proper medical attendance is even the right of a prisoner," the court said.
