 LUDHIANA: Besides entertaining people, cinema acts as a powerful medium of spreading awareness and educating the masses.   In view of this, the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) has decided to start a two-minute slideshow during the shows.   According to the information, acting on the directions of NACO, the State Aids Control Society has called tenders from private companies to tie up with cinemas to show a two-minute visual regarding HIV during the interval. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a staff member said discussions were in progress to show visuals regarding transmission of AIDS.   He said till now, the visuals only concentrated on showing one or two modes of transmission of the virus. "The duration of the slideshow must be extended and it must include all ways through which people can contract the infection," he added.   He said the proposal was in its initial stages and Ludhiana would be one of the districts where the project could kick off.   In a major step aimed at providing the best of treatment to people suffering from AIDS, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre will soon start its services at the civil hospital here. Earlier, residents were forced to go to Jalandhar or Amritsar for the same.   Talking to the TOI, Dr Geetika, district aids control programme officer said, "A plan is in the offing and tenders have already been called. However, it is difficult to tell when the project will kick off." She said the main idea behind starting such a programme is to spread awareness regarding the HIV.
