JAIPUR: Lives of four children in Rajasthan hang in the balance after fears that they might have been given HIV-tainted blood at a private nursing home.Indications are that the four children who reportedly received transfusions from blood sourced from Goyal Pathology Lab in Rajasthan's Sriganganagar district may now have been infected with HIV.This was realized after one of the donors at the lab who donated blood tested positive for HIV. The issue came to light when the parents alerted the Anoopgarh subdivision magistrate who in turn alerted the Rajasthan state health minister.Following this, the subdivision magistrate seized the records of Shyam Nursing Home where the transfusion took place and Goyal Pathology Lab, which donated the blood. The affected children's blood samples have now been sent for testing and a detailed report of the matter is expected soon. The state government has ordered a high-level inquiry into the case. Health minister Amamuddin Ahmed has promised an inquiry into the episode and said action would be taken against the hospital if it was found guilty of negligence.Talking to Times Now news channel, Ahmed said: "Preliminary reports have indicated the blood tested positive for HIV and if this is the case it is very unfortunate. The report will tell us and we will act."
