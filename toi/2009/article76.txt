 KOLKATA: The white cotton T-shirt can barely hold back his rippling biceps. He can bench-press 200 pounds for a warm-up. And, he is HIV-positive.   When bodybuilders from across the country pit muscle against muscle for the coveted Mr India title at the Netaji Indoor Stadium this weekend, there won't be anyone "more positive about life than him", says Khundrakpam Pradip Kumar.   For those who think HIV is the end of the road, Khundrakpam has a heart-warming, rip-roaring laugh. "For me, life started after I tested HIV-positive in 2000," says the 38-year-old Manipuri. He began bodybuilding in 2003.   "I was into drugs and that is how I contracted the virus. There was pain, anguish and a deep sense of guilt. That is when I decided to channelize all my emotions into body building and maintaining a fitness level," says Sagolband-born Khundrakpam.   Along with anti-retroviral therapy, Khundrakpam became a gym fanatic. Medals, titles followed. He won the senior Mr Manipur title in the 60 kg category and came runner-up at the Senior Mr India Challenge Cup in Trichur. This time, he is competing in the 55-kg division. He had to mortgage his sister's gold jewellery to make the trip to Kolkata.   "Despite living with HIV, his never-die attitude is amazing and inspirational," said Yangabam Nilbir, a fellow Manipuri participant in the championship. "I want to prove that HIV is not the end of the world. I want to be a role model for such patients and tell the world that WE CAN," said Khundrakpam.   Though he was chosen the brand ambassador of HIV/AIDS in 2008 by the Manipur State AIDS Control Society, the government has not given him any financial assistance. "I want to start a fitness centre for HIV youths. I don't have the funds but I am not giving up. I want to tell the youth to say no to drugs and embrace life."
