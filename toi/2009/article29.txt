    A resident of Mumbai, 35-year-old Sangeeta is HIV positive. She learnt about her condition only after her husband tested positive. In 2005, he died in a train accident leaving behind his wife and two children. They had been married 16 years. Now, Sangeeta wants her mother-in-law, Chandrawati, to help support the family.   She claims that her 65-year-old mother-in-law discriminated between her husband and his elder brother. She thinks it is because she is HIV positive. Demanding her rights and asserting her authority, Sangeeta asks Chandrawati for a stake in her property. How truthful are Sangeeta's claims? Will Sangeeta be able to win a battle she has begun?   This episode of Aap ki Kachehri celebrates the strength of a woman striving to support her family in a society that is quick to ostracize anyone with HIV. Here is the voice of the new woman.   Watch Dr. Kiran Bedi take charge of the situation on Aap Ki Kachehri - Kiran Ke Saath, 12th Feb, Thurs, 10.30 pm on Star Plus!
