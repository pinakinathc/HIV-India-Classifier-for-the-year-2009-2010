 NEW DELHI: Alarmed by the increasing cases of HIV/AIDS among its jawans due to unsafe sex, the BSF has decided to allow its personnel to bring their spouses to the nearest station of posting. The paramilitary force is also planning to have a special course for new recruits to brief them about the disease.   Director-general of BSF Raman Srivastava said the decision was taken after 299 cases of HIV/AIDS were reported among the personnel of the border guarding force. "We have taken a decision to allow our personnel to keep their spouse at the nearest village or town of his posting," Srivastava told reporters on Monday.   "All BSF personnel enjoy two months leave besides 15 days casual leave in a year. But allowing them to keep their spouses near the place of posting will help them in keeping themselves physically and mentally fit," he said when asked about the measures taken by BSF to deal with the situation.   Besides BSF, other paramilitary forces have also reported a number of HIV/AIDS cases among their personnel. CRPF has reported 273 full blown cases of AIDS in four years between 2005 and 2008, including 78 in 2008 alone. Besides, it has also reported 1,547 cases of HIV positive in the four-year period â€” 665 in 2008 alone.
