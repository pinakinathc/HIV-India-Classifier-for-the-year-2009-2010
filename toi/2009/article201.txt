 RAJASTHAN: It is a parent's worst nightmare. Because of a shocking lapse, the lives of four children in Rajasthan hang in the balance after fears that they might have been given HIV tainted blood.   The four children who allegedly received blood transfusions from the Goyal Pathology Lab in Rajasthan's Sriganganagar district may have been infected with HIV.   This was realised after one of the donors at the lab who has donated blood tested positive for the AIDS virus. The issue came to light when the parents alerted the Anoopgarh Sub Division Magistrate who in turn alerted the Rajasthan State Health Minister.   Following this, the Sub Division Magistrate has acted seizing the records of Shyam Nursing Home where the transfusion occured and the Pathology Lab which donated the blood.   Now, the children's blood samples have been sent for testing and an enquiry into the matter is pending. A detailed report is expected at any moment.   Meanwhile, the state government, on hearing about the incident, ordered a high-level inquiry into it. Health Minister Amamuddin Ahmed has promised an inquiry into the episode and has promised to act if the hospital in question is found guilty of negligence.   Amamuddin Ahmed, Rajasthan State Health Minister, said, "Preliminary reports have indicated that the blood was HIV + and if this is the case it is very unfortunate. The report will tell us and we will act."
