 KANPUR: "We are in the process of developing a compound which will inhibit the duration of HIV virus in human body. It will help in increasing the life span of HIV patients by 10-15 years", said Madhav S Mane, a PhD scholar, Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, while talking to TOI. Madhav participated in the 5th international Junior National Organic Symposium Trust (J-NOST) conference held at IIT-K.   Mane had been working on developing a compound which can slow the death rate of HIV patients. Mane had already spent three and a half years to develop the compound and looked forward to get the research published by December, next year.   "Once the research paper gets published, efforts will be made to file a patent. After this, we will make efforts to collaborate with some pharma company so that the compound can be tested on animals which is a costly affair", said Mane.   Meanwhile, another PhD scholar, CV Prasad from IIT-Madras had been working on developing a new molecule which will reduce the cost of anti-histamine drug used in allergic illness. "The completion of this research will enable the cost of anti-histamine drug to lower by fifty percent. However, the research had already been published in Royal Journal of Chemistry UK. he added. It is to be mentioned that nine member UK delegation of PhD scholars had come to IIT-Kanpur and took active part in the conference. Duncan from University of Sheffield, Hana from University of North Southampton and Kevin Jones from University of Cardiff unamiously expressed happiness over their first ever visit to India and IIT-Kanpur. "We are happy to interact with other PhD students here. This has given us a good opportunity to know more about the kind of research going on in India in the field of organic chemistry", concluded Kevin Jones, a PhD student.
