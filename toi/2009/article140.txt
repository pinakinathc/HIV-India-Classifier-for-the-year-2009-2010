 BELGAUM: SP Sonia Narang has called upon police personnel to create awareness on HIV among the public so that they have no fear to live with those afflicted by the deadly disease.   Speaking after inaugurating police training workshop organized by District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) at the SP's officer here on Wednesday, she said: "Even today, awareness about HIV/ AIDS is less among the general public. Many people, including some doctors, don't know how to handle HIV patients. Many people don't even touch AIDS patients fearing its spread." I want police personnel to know more on the disease so that they can pass on the information to others, she added.   Dr Vikas Inamdar, HIV and TB consultant, said HIV is manageable like any other chronic disease.   Shashidar, training officer, highlighted the need to spread awareness among the police on the disease. Forty-five police officers of the rank of DySP, CPI, PSI, ASI and head constables attended the workshop. District health officer Dr Dilip Kumar Munoli, training officers Dr V B Kulkarni and Nirmala were present.   SP Sonia Narang inaugurates a workshop on AIDS for police personnel in Belgaum.
