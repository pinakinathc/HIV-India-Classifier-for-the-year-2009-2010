CHANDIGARH: Anshu (name changed) is HIV positive. Her world came crashing down when she had learned about acquiring the immunity-debilitating infection 10 years ago. As she mustered courage to move on in life by collecting the shattered pieces around her, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) came along to extend a helping hand with the job of an outreach worker. But today, once again, her future seems bleak as uncertainty shrouds her employment.���When I was served a month���s notice, I was shocked. The appointment letter had clearly stated that we would be employed for a year,��� said Anshu, who earns Rs 3,000 per month as an outreach worker. She isn���t alone. Some 100 HIV positives, employed by NACO six months ago, are at risk of losing their source of sustenance. Under National AIDS Control Programme, Phase-3, NACO for the first time had employed people living with HIV at Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre to use their services as counsellors while making them self-reliant. However, in a recent communication from the ministry of health and family welfare to State AIDS Control Society (SACS), services of these outreach employees stand to be terminated by November-end.While SACS and some local NGOs had been the appointing authority for these workers, a private agency was now entrusted with the work of employing HIV positive people for various outreach activities. Dr Damodar Bachani, deputy director general, NACO, Delhi, said, ���India has been sanctioned Rolling Continuation Channel (Switzerland-based global funding agency under public-private partnership for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria) aid for outreach activities. Though a private agency has been hired for the purpose, our endeavour will be to retain those who are already employed.���As uncertainty looms over reappointments, Vanita Gupta, director, SACS, Chandigarh, said, ���We have received a communication from the ministry but our efforts will be to let efficient workers continue.���Not taking kindly to this move, seen more as a hindrance than an aid, Rajesh Gopal, joint project director, SACS, Gujarat, noted, ���The purpose of this outsourcing is not known... it seems it will deny easy accessibility to the needy.���
