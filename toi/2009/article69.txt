  : Four youngsters from the city have produced and directed `Negative about positive', a documentary aimed to create HIV/AIDS awareness. The 25-minute film highlights the trauma a patient faces.   Ravindra (director), Srikanth (cameraman), Harihara Manjunath (artiste) and Madhusudana Katte (co-director) narrate the story of Vijay (Ashwin Ramesh), who is in love with Suchithra (Sahanasri). However, she dumps him on learning he is HIV positive. A close friend Madhu (Sanjay Yadav) also starts to ignore and avoid him. Lonely and miserable, Vijay decides to end his life, but a call from the nursing home where he was diagnosed brings relief.   Ravindra said the film is not a commercial project and will be screened free of cost at schools, colleges, clubs and social welfare organizations. "The intention is to teach people about how the disease is contracted and what a patient goes through, losing love, affection and companionship.''
