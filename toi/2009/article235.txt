 BANGALORE: In a bid to be politically correct, the Indian Railways will now call HIV/AIDS patients as "people with immune deficiency". They can also now hold on to their certificates proving their condition for a little while longer.   Following a Supreme Court order recently, the railway ministry mulled over giving 75% concession in some classes of tickets for HIV positive and AIDS patients. Currently, patients suffering from cancer, thalassemia, haemophilia, heart and kidney conditions and mental illnesses are eligible for up to 75% concession in all classes of tickets.   A check with South Western Railway officials revealed that AIDS patients are yet to be given this relief. Currently, only 50% of the fare in unreserved II Class is allowed. The only respite, say officials, is that the certificate from doctors to validate their claim is now valid for six months instead of the earlier three months.   SWR officials told TOI the proposal was mooted in the 2008 budget. But the new order from Delhi to allow 75% concession is yet to reach them. It seems that news of this concession is yet to reach the beneficiaries as well.   A representative of Freedom Foundation, an NGO that works with HIV positive people, said that none of their people had availed the concession. "We were under the impression that the concession was still being negotiated and not entirely in place. As far as we know, HIV/AIDS patients have only availed concessions on bus tickets and not train tickets," she added.   toiblr.reporter@timesgroup.com
