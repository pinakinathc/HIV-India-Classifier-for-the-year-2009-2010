JAIPUR: In a major respite for all HIV/AIDS patients, the state health department has ordered free treatment for them at all government facilities. Orders for immediate implementation of the scheme were recently released by the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). "The antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control AIDS symptoms is already being provided free at selected medical facilities. However, when these patients contracted other infections they had to pay for expensive treatment which will now be free," says a health official. Under the new set-up the state government has decided to bring the HIV patients under the 'Chief Minister BPL Jeevan Raksha Scheme' providing free access to all tests, treatments and drugs available at government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. Apart from providing economic relief to nearly 25,000 registered HIV positives in the state, the decision will also act as motivator for more HIV positive patients to come forward and get themselves registered. Even those taking unauthorised treatment will now be interested to register themselves. "The integrated testing and counselling centres (ICTC) have registered nearly 25,000 HIV positives in the state. However, nearly 25% of them have not enrolled themselves at local ART centres. Efforts to bring more such people under government umbrella will help in better monitoring of AIDS in the state," says a Rajasthan State Aids Control Society official. Meanwhile, mainstream efforts are also being made in the state with the help of United Nation Development Projects (UNDP) and local NGOs to generate a fear-free environment for the HIV positives. As a result the understanding and acceptance towards the HIV patients has increased lately as most of the government departments and even private companies are sensitised about the issue. Link activists have also been deployed in the areas of high prevalence with the help of NGOs.
