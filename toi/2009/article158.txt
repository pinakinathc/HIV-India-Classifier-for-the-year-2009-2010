 VADODARA: For needy patients living with HIV, getting a below poverty line (BPL) card will no longer be difficult. Thanks to a city-based association of people living with HIV, life will become much more easier for HIV+ persons with the card, making them eligible for free second line anti-retroviral treatment (ART).   The National Aids Control Organization (NACO) is likely to include a clause in its new guidelines to be issued shortly that only those persons who have BPL cards will get free of cost second line ART. The second line ART is expensive and poor patients may not be able to afford it. Those who do not have the card will have to pay for the medication.   AP+, an association of persons living with HIV, has so far helped 50 patients to obtain BPL cards. "Second line ART treatment is very expensive. There are families where all the members are HIV positive and without the BPL card it would be beyond their means to afford the treatment. The BPL card will ensure that such families don't discontinue their treatment owing to financial constraints," said Hasim Pinwala, vice-president of AP+.   AP+ had written to state government requesting it to issue BPL cards to such people at the earliest. The government has authorized AP+ to help the beneficiaries to fill up the forms.   "There were few cases wherein people with HIV were finding it tough to get BPL cards. It is then that we decided to write to the state government highlighting the problems faced by such people," Pinwala added.   He said this facility will only be available to members registered with their association. "All the forms will be filled up and attested by us and submitted to the government with necessary documents," Pinwala stated.   With a BPL card, these patients can get food and medicines at subsidised rates from the government departments concerned.
