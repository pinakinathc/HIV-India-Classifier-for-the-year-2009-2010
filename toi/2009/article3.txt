 HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to distribute a monthly pension of Rs 200 to each AIDS patient undergoing anti-retroviral therapy in the state.   The state government has identified around 50,000 such patients of whom about 80 per cent fell under the below poverty line category.   "All such patients in the BPL category will be given the pension from this month," state information minister A Ramanarayana Reddy said.   Briefing newsmen about the Cabinet decisions, the minister said these patients were "unable to make a living in view of social stigma, discrimination and low level of income."   Hence, the pension scheme was introduced, he said adding that there would not be any restriction on the number of persons eligible to receive the sum in a family.   The respective district collectors would sanction the pension, he said.
