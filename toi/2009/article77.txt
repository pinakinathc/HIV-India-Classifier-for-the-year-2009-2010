  : Population Services International (PSI) will conduct a skit competition based on the theme of HIV/AIDS to create awareness among people so that they contribute positively towards this cause. It is open for both corporates and individuals.   Based on the concept of interactivity, people can enact their own impressions either with a team or solo, from their offices or home. They are invited to script, enact and produce a play through a website www.positivenegative.in. This is a video-sharing website where people can upload their videos for free. Out of all the entries, the best videos will be shortlisted and given an award.   The need to educate the corporate audience and eradicate the stigma attached to the disease is this initiative's objective. PSI intends to reach out to and encourage the web-savvy corporate audience to adopt this cause. The idea is also to leverage the ever-growing networking community to spread the message and receive support from them to increase HIV/ AIDS awareness.
