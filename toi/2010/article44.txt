 PANAJI: A 38-year-old woman from Pernem jumped to her death from the first floor of Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) on Monday morning after being told that she was HIV positive, her relatives have claimed.   However, the hospital's medical superintendent Dr Rajan Kuncolienkar refused to confirm if the woman was HIV positive. "I have not seen her case papers so I do not know," he said.   The woman, a widow, was admitted to GMC on July 9 and was undergoing treatment for an enlarged liver and spleen, GMC sources said. She was initially brought to GMC for tests as she was not keeping well despite continuous medication. Sources said the woman was suffering from depression after a doctor told her about her status on Saturday. The sources added that the mandatory counselling was not done.
