 CHANDIGARH: Rejecting the plea of an Army personnel infected with HIV, Chandigarh bench of Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has held that the soldier cannot claim disability pension because the virus is neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service. While passing the orders, the bench has relied on the opinion of the medical board that conducted the medical examination of the personnel.   A division bench comprising judicial member Justice Ghanshyam Prasad and administrative member Lt Gen NS Brar passed the order while rejecting a petition by Havildar Raj Kumar, who joined the Army in September 1985 and was discharged on August 27, 2002, on medical grounds â€” of HIV infection with disseminated tuberculosis (TB).   In order to get disability pension in addition to the service pension, Kumar contended that since he was fit when he joined the Army and that HIV infection was attributable to military service. He also argued that he got the virus after suffering from TB.   "Since TB was attributable to military service, HIV should also be considered in the same light, hence I am entitled for disability pension " he pleaded.   Contesting the plea, the Union government counsel Captain Sandeep Bansal submitted that as per the medical board, the petitioner was admitted in the military hospital on November 17, 2001.
