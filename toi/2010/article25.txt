 LUDHIANA: To keep a track on TB patients as they are on the high-risk list of contacting HIV, the health department launched the concept of offering voluntary testing and compulsory counselling for them.   Sources said the integrated package has been started on April 1. Under this, all TB patients arriving for sputum tests would be provided voluntary counselling on HIV and motivated to opt for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC).   Presently, the district health department does not have the data regarding the number of TB patients suffering from HIV.   Giving information, an official of the health department said under this programme, after motivation if the patient agrees to go for testing and reports show him or her to be HIV positive, the patient would be given drugs — antiretroviral therapy — free of cost. More than 500 arrive at the civil hospital for sputum tests daily.   A staff member of ICTC said most people suffering from TB are at higher risk of being infected with the virus. But due to lack of awareness, they do not come for voluntary testing and the patients themselves are not aware of their HIV status.   District TB officer Ashish Ahuja said this has been started with the aim to create awareness and to check the incident rate of HIV among TB patients. Around 5% of TB patients are HIV positive, he cited.
