    Former Miss India Gul Panag, French ambassador to India Jerome Bonnafont and minister of state (rural development) Agatha Sangma were the chief guests at the programme. Looking elegant in a white suit, Gul referred to one of the guests at the do, Pradip Kumar, and said, "Look at Pradip living his life with such enthusiasm. I think people living with this syndrome have every right to be present among society and get their share of happiness. Others must understand this and help them in achieving it."   CHAMPION: Pradip, who won a silver medal in the All India Body Building Championship 2010 in Goa recently, said "I've been living with this syndrome for a long time now and I feel like I can fulfill all my dreams." Several dance performances were rendered on the occasion by HIV positive children. "As a foreign country's representative in India, it gives me special pleasure in doing something for the upliftment of orphans and specially those kids living with HIV here. I have pledged to offer my full support for this cause in India. I feel happy about it," said Bonnafont. Guests at the do also signed on a board and wrote special messages, showing their solidarity with the cause. Participants and guests were seen sporting 'I Am Positive' badges.
