 NEW DELHI: In a major decision, the Centre on Thursday agreed to extend crucial second-line anti-retroviral (ART) treatment to all HIV-positive persons shedding its earlier reservations in providing this costly medication regime to those who had been treated in private hospitals.   The Centre had serious reservations in taking on HIV positive persons who had been irrationally treated by private hospitals for second-line treatment but it bowed to the SC's argument that the government could not discriminate in extending medical facilities when the core question was right to life.   Senior advocate T S Doabia, appearing for the health ministry, informed a Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that National AIDS Control Organisation has decided to extend second-line ART to all HIV positive patients at four centres of excellence in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.   "This facility will gradually extended to all 10 such centres in pahses," he said, adding that this experiment would continue for a period of three months. While first-line ART costs Rs 6,500 per year for each patient, the second line is more than four times costlier at Rs 28,500.   In an affidavit before the SC, NACO had said second-line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received "irrational treatment" from private medical practitioners.
