 NAGPUR: Despite the media highlighting the causes and effect of AIDS over the last so many years, the rise in number of cases is unabated in Nagpur district. On an average, one person is affected with the disease every fifth day in the second capital of the state.   According to statistics provided by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), as many as 1,812 persons were reported to have been affected with the deadly disease, and 430 deaths were reported from August 1986 to September 2010.   Chandrapur district, which is also notorious for the disease, registered 1,827 persons affected with AIDS in the same period. However, only 220 deaths were reported in this border district.   Additional project director of MSACS Dr Dilip Deshmukh said that across the state as many as 98,697 persons have been afflicted with AIDS from 1986 to September 2010, and 7,263 deaths have been reported.

He, however, expressed concern over the rise in HIV positive cases among women. Dr Deshmukh said that at present the ratio of the disease is 40:60, with more women being detected as being afflicted by the disease.   Further, he said that 7.1% of the population in the age group of 15 to 24 years of age is HIV positive, while 35.6% HIV positive persons are between the age group of 25 to 34 years. Similarly, 41.9 % persons come from the age group of 35 to 49 years, said Dr Deshmukh.   He that Vidarbha as a region has shown some improvement as far as HIV positive cases are concerned.   Quoting a study conducted by MSACS, Dr Deshmukh said that in 2008-2009, 19 districts were found at high risk as far as HIV positive cases are concerned. This include three districts from Vidarbha region - Nagpur, Chandrapur and Yavatmal. However, during the current financial year of 2010-2011, number of HIV positive cases has come down drastically, he claimed.   This year till October, blood samples of 12,05,640 persons had been examined and of these 58,344 persons were found to be HIV positive. Also, of the 8,78,549 pregnant women tested for HIV, 2,908 were found positive.
