 PATNA: The city observed World AIDS Day on Wednesday with several organisations taking a pledge to check the spread of the deadly disease.   That there are 35,440 HIV+ men and women in Bihar was noted with concern at an AIDS awareness camp organised by `Sukh Sansar' in Rukunpura locality. Women accounted for 35% of the HIV+ cases in the state where the risk factors include acute poverty, primarily among the rural population, said marketing expert of contraceptives, Sanjay Kumar, while addressing the participants at the camp. The theme of the camp was "Universal Access and Human Rights".   Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) and a voluntary organisation, Centre Direct, observed the day by distributing 30,000 condoms near the Patna Junction roundabout, Gandhi Maidan, Bansghat, Mandiri, Kurji More, Boring Road, R-Bloc crossing and Raja Bazaar.
