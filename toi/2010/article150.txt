      But the scientists at Hanover university hospital or MHH in northern Germany said they have yet to find a way to put the substance, VIR-576, in a pill. All the test patients received it as an intravenous drip.
      
      
      Variants of the new therapy could also be devised to fight measles, hepatitis C and Ebola disease, they said.
      
      
      VIR-576 is a protein that smothers human immunodeficiency virus, stopping it docking with cells in the human body.
      
      
      "It is a completely new therapy approach which we hope will reduce ," said Reinhold E Schmidt of MHH. Other existing medicines offered since the mid-1990s work by proofing cells of the body against the virus.
      
      
      "Our peptide works on the virus, not on the cells, so some of the side-effects won't happen at all," he said.
      
      
      Current  medications ensure an almost normal life span for HIV-infected people but raise the risk of strokes and liver damage. VIR-576 caused some diarrhoea, but no other major side effects, the tests suggested.
      
      
      Schmidt cautioned that it could take years before VIR-576 was available from pharmacies as a medicine.
