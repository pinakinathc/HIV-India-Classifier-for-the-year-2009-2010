 KOLKATA: Superstitions and prejudices related to HIV+ patients reared its ugly head on Monday when a West Bengal woman was prevented by villagers from cremating the body of her HIV+ husband for several hours.   Eight-year-old Debnath, the elder of the two sons of Barnali and Nil Madhab of Hanturia village near Howrah, finally lit his father's pyre around 3pm under heavy police protection after health officials failed to convince the villagers.   Nil Madhab, a truck driver was 32 when he was detected HIV+ three years ago. Since then, he has been undergoing treatment at NRS Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata. His condition gradually deteriorated. Last Sunday night when Barnali went to check out Nil Madhab's condition, she found him dead. "I tried to rub his hand but it was cold. I realized he had passed away in sleep. Since it was late in the night, all I could do was wait for dawn so that I could inform neighbours," Barnali said.   When neighbours learnt about Nil Madhab's death, they began gathering before his house, not to extend help, but confabulate on what to do. Soon, a 1,200-strong mob gathered with some demanding Nil Madhab's body be taken away from the village as it was "contaminated".   "I sought their help. Not only did they refuse to carry the body to the burning ghat at Memari, some of them said they would not allow his cremation there," said Barnali.
