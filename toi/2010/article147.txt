 CHANDIGARH: Schools should play a significant role in preventing HIV infection by educating the students to abstain from sexual intercourse and also adopt safer sexual practices. Health professionals would be appropriate for such educational programmes for adolescents rather than their own teachers. Family life education should be incorporated in the school curriculum. These are some of the suggestions received by the HIV\AIDS education programmers of Nehru Yuva Kendra from at least 800 adolescent (10-19 years) boys and girls' students from the UT villages and slums.   One of the senior study programmer Avnish Jolly said,"Teachers themselves expressed their reservations about discussing such topics with their students."   The results of the study suggest that health education can play a major role in improving the knowledge and attitude of the adolescent girls with reference to reproductive health, including HIV\AIDS. The study results further suggested that there is a need for evolving information, education and communication strategies to focus on raising awareness on adolescent reproductive health.   Nehru Yuva Kendra's district youth co-ordinator, GS Bajwa said,"The objectives of the study were two-fold. Firstly to assess the knowledge of adolescent girls regarding cause, transmission and prevention of STIs including HIV\AIDS. Secondly to study the effect of health education programmes in terms of improvement of knowledge and change in their attitude." Jolly informed students? response rate was 98 % and though they had good knowledge regarding modes of transmission, they had some misconceptions about its spreading and this significantly improved after the intervention.   ?It was observed the girls had a reasonably good knowledge regarding HIV\AIDS even before their intervention. This is   probably due to better literacy rate in the area, despite being rural in setting.
