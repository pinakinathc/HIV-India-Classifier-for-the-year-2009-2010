BELGAUM: Marriage bureaux of all hues and sizes are mushrooming by the day - both online and offline. While they are busy in match-making of aspiring brides and grooms, the one here stands out - it makes matches of those who are tested positive to HIV/ AIDS.Spandana Positive Marriage Bureau has successfully arranged the marriage of 19 such couples ever since its inception a year ago. NGO Spandana, having a good database of "HIV positives" of the district, helps the families of wannabe brides/ grooms to visit each other's houses. But for being HIV+, the NGO does not consider other criteria like caste, religion, area, financial status, etc.Sharing their success with the 'Sunday Times of India', Mahesh Jadhav, Spandana advisory committee member, said: "All the couples married through our bureau are leading a happy life. Sadly, a woman was widowed after her husband died."The marriages will be registered in the headship of the bureau. The couples will also be made to sign on a stamp paper, pledging their loyalty to one another. The groom should compulsorily make a fixed deposit of Rs 10,000 in his wife's name in the bank. The bureau charges Rs 2,000 from the newlyweds as a donation.
