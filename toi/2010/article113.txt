Though the prevalence rate of 0.75% is higher than the national average of 0.69%, it is still lower compared to the rate of the state, which is at 0.86%.   Dr Kishore Kumar, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer told `The Times of India' that the general cases recorded since 2007 have seen a decline this year till October. While 1,245 positive cases were detected in 2007, this year there have been only 815 till October end. The cases are recorded for 12 months starting January. Of the 815 cases, as many as 297 are from outside the district.   The taluk-wise break up of the cases is as follows: While Mangalore recorded the highest at 298, the least was in Sullia at 22, followed by Bantwal (82), Belthangady (62) and Puttur at 55. Of these, 528 cases are male and 287 are women. Dr Kishore said the prevalence as usual was the highest among the sexually-active in the age group of 16 to 45 at 656. There 12 children with HIV below the age of five and 24 in the group of five to 15 years. The DAPCU officer said 90% of the transmission cases were by the sexual route.

In this case also, the figures have seen a decline since 2007 from 82, despite the number of patients tested was 19,421 as compared to 14,764 cases tested in 2007.   Dr Kishore said the nevirapine (drug used to treat HIV infection) regimen with pregnant women had seen mother-to-child transmission cases come down drastically. "Of the 72 deliveries, we have had only two positive cases," he said. Nevirapine is administered both to mother and child (within 72 hours) at the time of delivery. The child is tested with DNA PCR for infection at six weeks and whatever the result, the anti-body test is done after 18 months for confirmation.   stanly.pinto@timesgroup.com
