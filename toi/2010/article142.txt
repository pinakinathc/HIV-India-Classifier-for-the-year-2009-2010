BELGAUM: An HIV-infected family of five at Palabhavi village in Raibag taluk of Belgaum district is paying a steep price for the insensitivity of government officials. Customers have stopped coming to Shekhar's tea stall, wife Sangeeta lost her job as an assistant cook in the local school and their three sons are being shunned by classmates and teachers.All because government officials didn't maintain confidentiality about the family's HIV status in the central government's Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme. In this scheme, HIV families get foodgrains at subsidized rates from the food & civil supplies department. After officials revealed their medical condition to villagers about three months ago, the family of Shekhar has been ostracized. "It all began when the sanction letter of the AAY card reached the gram panchayat. Two days later, GP members met with school development managing committee members and the headmaster told me not to come to work from the next day," Sangeeta told STOI.Shekhar said, "We were happy despite our problem. We've known about our disease for about one-and-a-half years but never told anyone about it. After that letter, my sons were not even allowed to drink water from the school tap."Shekhar asked the authorities why their personal details were disclosed. The couple even considered committing suicide, but timely intervention of NGOs gave them hope.A senior officer of the food and civil supplies department said, "It's possible the tahsildar inadvertently sent the sanction letters to the gram panchayat. We'll look into the issue," he added.Raghavendra T, deputy director, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust, said, "It's a clear violation of human rights. Nobody can breach confidentiality, particularly in such cases."Deputy commissioner Ekroop Kaur said, "It's a serious issue and I'll issue a directive to all offices to avoid such mistakes. I'll also try to ensure Sangeeta gets her job back, if she wants it."
