 VARANASI: New cases of HIV positive are being reported from the prisons of Varanasi division. On Saturday, two new cases of HIV positive were detected in the district jail.   According to Arvind Singh, counsellor of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC), Varanasi Central Jail, the two new HIV positive inmates (18 and 22 years of age) are injecting blood users. Their cases have been referred to the anti-retro viral therapy (ART) centre of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) for anti-retro viral therapy. The Central Jail's ICTC also looks after the district jail and mental hospital for counselling and testing of inmates.   With this, the number of HIP positive prisoners have become four in the district jail while the Central Jail has seven such inmates. The National AIDS Control Society (NACO) began the ICTC at the Central Jail in January 2009.   The alarming situation is that the HIV positive youth do not want to disclose the fact to their family members, Singh said and added such a tendency would infect others as well.
