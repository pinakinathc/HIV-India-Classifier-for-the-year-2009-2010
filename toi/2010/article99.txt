 CHANDIGARH: This Diwali will be unlike any other for some 175 kids who have grown up with the harsher realities of life. Children suffering from AIDS and kids of HIV-affected parents look forward to a Diwali which adds not just light and sweetness into their lives but also ushers in vibrant hues of carefree demeanour that make each day a celebration for these little angels.   With an attempt to lighten up these 175 faces, People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLHA), an NGO, has collected Rs 50,000 from various religious and charitable trusts. The HIV-affected kids from the Tricity have their wishlist ready for the festival. Phuljharis, clothes, toys, shoes and sweets are all part of their idea of fun.   "We could have never collected such a huge amount for the occasion on our own. Some religious organizations have come forward to chip in for the cause," said Pooja Thakur, president of PLHA.   "These children include the ones suffering from HIV and those who lost their parents to AIDS. Most of the individual donors prefer anonymity. These donors consider lighting up the lives of HIV-affected kids a more auspicious gesture than paying visit to a temple on Diwali," said Pooja.   The PLHA members say the amount will not be spent on Diwali alone. A part will be utilized for the treatment of these kids.   "We need money for medicines. A lot of time gets wasted in relying on the state machinery or central funding agencies. These voluntary aids are beneficial," noted Nawindu Jha, project coordinator at the drop-in-centre, State Aids Control. Most of these kids have no choice but to give up on hope as they are deprived of regular things in life. Expressing excitement, an HIV-affected teen said, "I plan to burst a lot of crackers. I am also excited about the new clothes and shoes and can't wait for Diwali."
