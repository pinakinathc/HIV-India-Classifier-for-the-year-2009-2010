 CHANDIGARH: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has painted a gloomy picture for the city, saying that "the prevalence of HIV cases among high risk groups in Chandigarh is among the highest in the country."   NACO data reveals that the HIV positive prevalence rate is quite high among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Chandigarh and Punjab — 26.1%, way above the national figure of 9.19%.   In Chandigarh, up to March, as many as 5,594 persons had been screened, out of which 245 were found HIV positive — with total positivity of four per cent. In case of pregnant women, 5,131 were screened, out of which 30 were found HIV positive — with 0.1% positivity in Chandigarh.   "Recently, a three-day state-level workshop on data triangulation for epidemiological profiling of HIV/AIDS patients was organised at GMCH, Sector 32. It was organised by GMCH with back up from NACO and UNAIDS to find out gaps and fix future needs for combating HIV/AIDS menace in the region," said DR Yujwal, NACO's national technical adviser.   The report, which will be ready by August-end, will be submitted to NACO, Union ministry of health and family welfare and UNAIDS for hammering out a national strategy to combat the menace of the deadly disease.
