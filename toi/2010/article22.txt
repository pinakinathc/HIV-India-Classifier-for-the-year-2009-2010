 MARGAO: South Goa district centre of Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanganthan (NYKS) has established some 75 red ribbon clubs in the South Goa district as mandated by the National AIDS Control Origination (NACO).   NYKS, which boasts of having an extensive network of youth organizations, especially in the rural areas, has been roped in by the National AIDS Control Organization and Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) to carry on the mission expressed through the Red Ribbon Express, a mega project for AIDS awareness, in India.   Chief coordinator of Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanganthan Shirish Lawande told TOI that the clubs have been formed through the network of 117 youth clubs of the NYKS established in the five blocks of Quepem, Canacona, Salcete, Sanguem and Mormugoa.   "NYKS has formed 75 red ribbon clubs so far. Red ribbon clubs are dedicated to AIDS awareness and aimed at taking AIDS prevention message to the hinterland as mandated by the Union health ministry," informed Lawande.   "Delivering lectures, conducting seminars and holding street plays on HIV/ AIDS are some of the activities undertaken by these clubs in rural areas of south Goa. Rural youth clubs also facilitate interaction among the youth and other vulnerable population on HIV/AIDS which is still considered a topic of social stigma," he explained.   Recently, a workshop for 30 out of the 75 red ribbon clubs was held at Margao wherein officials of GSACS briefed club members on conducting various activities related to AIDS awareness. "The second workshop will be held at Quepem for another 30 clubs, while for the remaining 35 clubs a similar session will be conducted at Canacona," he said.
