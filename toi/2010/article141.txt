 CHOUTUPPAL (NALGONDA): In a shocking incident, a man allegedly murdered his wife and two children and later attempted suicide in Choutuppal on Saturday. He was rushed to a private hospital in Hyderabad in a critical condition. Sources said the accused resorted to the extreme action after it was diagnosed that he is HIV-positive.   Local ward member Linga Swamy reportedly administered poison-laced cold drink to wife Jayaprada, 27, daughter Ramya, 12 and son Sachin, 10. When they lost consciousness, he allegedly hanged them from the ceiling in the house with a plastic rope. Later, he tried to hang himself with the same rope but the rope snapped and he fell down hurting his head. He suffered a bleeding injury.   Swamy's sister, who stays with them, raised an alarm after seeing his injured brother and alerted the neighbours who rushed him to the hospital. Locals said Swamy was having disputes with Jayaprada and the couple quarrelled on Friday night. But Choutuppal CI Tirupathanna said as per preliminary investigation, Swamy was upset ever since he was found HIV-positive.   "He might have taken his frustration on his wife and children and later tried to end his life. He doesn't have any financial and family disputes," a police official said. A case has been registered and the bodies sent to the hospital for an autopsy.
