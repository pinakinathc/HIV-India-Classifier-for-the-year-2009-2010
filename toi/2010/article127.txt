 VADODARA: One of India's best known gay rights activist, prince of the erstwhile state of Rajpipla Manvendra Singh Gohil, will soon join hands with the first lady of France, Carla Bruni, to create awareness on HIV and AIDS in India.   While many may be hoping to just get a glimpse of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla during their state visit to India beginning on Saturday, Gohil shared the same table with the former model at a dinner organised to create awareness on HIV and AIDS related issues in Paris recently. The event had been organised by AIDES â€” a French organisation working for HIV and AIDS since 1984.   While Lakshya Trust, run by Gohil, works for HIV and AIDS-infected persons, Bruni is ambassador for the Geneva-based Global Fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. "Carla said she would like to be associated with us and was well-informed about my work and that of Lakshya Trust," said Gohil after returning from France. In fact, Gohil and Carla seemed to strike a good camaraderie at the dinner and subsequently at an event at the presidential palace in Paris on the occasion of the World AIDS Day on Wednesday.   "I have promised her help in any project she plans to take up on HIV and AIDS," Gohil added. Carla was particularly keen on a programme focused on preventing spread of the infection from women to children. Lakshya Trust project director Sylvester Merchant, who accompanied Gohil to France, said, "Carla was the guest of honour at the event. Sarkozy also made an appearance at the event along with several other celebrities".
