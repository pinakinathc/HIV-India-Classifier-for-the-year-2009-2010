 VADODARA: The Geneva-based Global Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria may help in crucial HIV-AIDS prevention programmes in India. While the meeting between gay prince of Rajpipla Manvendra Singh Gohil and French first lady Carla Bruni could not materialise due to the latter's arrival in Mumbai getting delayed, functionaries from the fund met Gohil and discussed several issues.   Gohil said Bruni got delayed in Delhi and had a packed schedule forcing her to skip the meeting. He added that the officials from the global fund, however, showed keen interest on the work being done on HIV-AIDS prevention in India.   "They were particularly surprised at the manner in which we were functioning in Gujarat. They found this quite in contrast with their experience in Delhi. They found that the people here were more accommodative than that in North India," Gohil said.   Gohil said he had invited the global fund representatives to visit Gujarat. "This would give them a better understanding of our work. They said that they were open to the idea and would consider it in the future," he said. Gohil added that he would be sending them a series of data and reports so that concrete plans can be worked out.
