CHENNAI: On Saturday, if somebody walks up to you and asks if you want a hug, don't shy away. They just want to make you feel better, no strings attached.Inspired by the Free Hugs Campaign, a global movement started by an Australian known as Juan Mann in 2004, a bunch of 30 youngsters are all set to dole out free hugs.Teams of five will position themselves in places where crowds gather Elliot's Beach in Besant Nagar, Ampa Skywalk in Aminjikarai, Spencer Plaza or Pantheon Road in Egmore, Citi Centre in Mylapore, Ispahani Centre in Nungambakkam and at the Anna Nagar Roundtana with placards that say "Free Hugs"."I am very excited to be a part of this campaign. There are times I would have appreciated a hug, even from a perfect stranger," says Manisha, one of the huggers. Each member of the team is expected to hug at least 200 people. The team's target is reaching out to 10,000 people in a day.And no, they are not afraid of being molested. "Crowded places mean we will have police protection and nobody will mess with us. I have seen a lot of videos of similar campaigns elsewhere in the world and nobody has ever acted up. So I am not afraid of people misbehaving," she says.Though the global movement has no specific message other than to make people feel better, the Chennai huggers have decided to create awareness on AIDS. "When we went to ask the permission of the police to conduct the hugathon', the police commissioner asked us why we are doing it. We wanted to make the most of the situation, so we decided to spread the message that AIDS is not contracted by hugging," said co-ordinator Karthick Sundar. "Spread love. Hug all... AIDS is not spread this way!" is the message that this warm gesture will spread.
