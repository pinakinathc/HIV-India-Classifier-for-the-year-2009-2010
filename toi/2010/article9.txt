  ALLAHABAD: Ostracised by society and abandoned by family members, a young HIV patient allegedly committed suicide by setting himself afire in the district, police said here on Wednesday.   The incident took place in Koskharatala Mahadevpura village of Koraon tehsil, about 65 kms from here, when the 25-year-old youth took the extreme step on Tuesday night, police said.   The youth's HIV status was detected last year when he went in for tests following prolonged illness. The results evoked disdain from villagers who banished him from all community gatherings for fear of "spread of infection", police said.   This compelled the youth to move out of his house a few months ago and live in a tiny hut on the outskirts of the village.
