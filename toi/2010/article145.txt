 GURGAON: Following a report that a private school in Gurgaon denied admission to eight HIV positive children, the state education department has sought a detailed report from the District Education Officer by December 27.   A spokesman of education department said that at present the said children are studying in government schools. Department officer said that in case the alleged school was found guilty of discrimination, strict action would be taken against it.   The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 clearly states that a child suffering from disability has the right to pursue free education. The state education departments rules also mandates admission without any discrimination. According to NGO Drone Foundation, which looks after these children, the kids are treated poorly at their school and the teacher in-charge of the government-run school warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest.   The children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. Though the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August, said Sunita Gupta, chairperson of Drone Foundation.   Principal of DPS, Maruti Kunj, Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. Such children need special care. We talked to doctors and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases, said Pandit.
