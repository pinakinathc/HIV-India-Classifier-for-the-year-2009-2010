 BELGAUM: The Government Kannada School No. 22 in Sadashivnagar here is almost empty these days. Parents have stopped sending their children to the school from Monday after learning that there are HIV-positive students too. They are now demanding that the HIV-positive students be segregated.   And quite shockingly, the School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC) supported the parents' demand and passed a resolution in this regard. There are 22 orphan and HIV-positive students under the care of NGO Spandana, who are schooling here. They play and participate in all school activities along with normal students.   Recently, when parents of other students learnt about this, they approached the school authorities and asked them to make separate arrangements for HIV-positive students, and warned that they would not send their children.   SDMC president Sunanda Kumbhargoudar called a meeting to discuss the matter on Tuesday. Ward councillor Vidya Mali, Spandana president Mahantesh Mali, Cluster Resource Person (CRP) from the education department Vasant Katti and parents were present. During the meeting, Mahantesh Mali took the SDMC members to task. He said there are 34 such children at Spandana, studying in different government schools. "No school has raised any objection so far," he said.
