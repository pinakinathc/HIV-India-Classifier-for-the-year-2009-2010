 CHANDIGARH: Sometimes, mother's milk can make a child suffer life-long agony of a dreadful virus HIV. To prevent this transmission, the State Aids Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, has started providing free milk powder to the HIV-positive mothers until the child is six months. It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age.   SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, "Breastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection."   "The mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months. At the time of anti-retroviral therapy, we screen out expectant mothers who can avail this scheme from their nearest integrated counselling and testing centres,?"she adds.   The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS.   HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby's intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita.   Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood. This small initiative can make some difference for them. Recently, three mothers have received the benefit of the scheme, said Pooja Thakur, president of the People living with HIV/AIDS.
