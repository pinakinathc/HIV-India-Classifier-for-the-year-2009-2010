 PUNE: Prompt availability of anti-retroviral therapy, facilities like community-care centres, improved post-natal care to newborn babies of HIV positive mothers, setting up of second line ART link centres at civil hospitals across the state, letting HIV positive mothers benefit from the Sanjay Gandhi pension scheme, and providing a consistent source of livelihood to needy HIV positive people, are some demands of the Life Process Help Foundation. It works for the treatment and rehabilitation of HIV/AIDS patients in Pune.   "Future generations must grow healthy. Children of HIV/AIDS patients should be given proper facilities. Government hospitals should provide prompt treatment to such patients," said Hamid Salmani, the foundation's president on Tuesday. The demands will be submitted to district collector Chandrakant Dalvi after Saturday.   Prompt issue of ration cards to needy HIV patients, providing them road transport services at concessional rates, and easing the tribulations faced by HIV positive mothers, are part of the list of demands put forth by the foundation. "HIV infected mothers are not given proper post-delivery counselling. We want NACO to supply milk powder every month for a year through the ART centres in the state to help mothers cut down medical expenses," said Salmani.   The Sanjay Gandhi pension scheme will also help the HIV infected and widowed. "We've seen that they get pension after several months and it is used up quickly. Timely payments will help mothers look after their children better," said Salmani.   More importantly, HIV positive patients from modest backgrounds, should get the benefit of free medical tests. "We've also demanded that tests like MRI and angiography should be free to HIV/AIDS patients," said Salmani.   The foundation will also write to the National AIDS Control Organisation and the central health ministry.
