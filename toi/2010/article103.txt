 CHANDIGARH: It may just become possible to fight the dreaded HIV type 1 virus. And, a particular algae and herbal plant found in northern India would be the tool.   This has recently been proved in a research of anti-HIV drug at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Mohali in Punjab.   The algae and herbal plant have chemicals with potent anti-viral structure. Imitating these structures, a compound has been synthesized to fight HIV type 1 virus.   A patent has been filed as this is the first such compound which has shown a protection rate of 78.17% against the HIV virus (the standard percentage is 89.75). The project, which has been completed recently and collaborated with National Centre for Cell Science, Pune University, had been sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology, Delhi. The main objective behind developing such a compound was to introduce another set of compounds and their family which are not yet resistant to the HIV virus.   The principal investigator of the project, Prof KK Bhutani said, "There are existing therapies, which have effectively suppressed the virus replication and prolonged the life of such patients. But there are mutant viruses resistant to the current drugs."   He added, "So, we took up this project of development of new types of anti-HIV drugs based on the chemical structure of some of the plants which have been known for possessing anti-infection properties."   The Pune University had done all the preclinical trials on animals to test the efficacy of the compound. "The toxicity tests have been successfully completed. Plants were screened and only those were selected for imitation and modification of the structure which had properties of anti-infection," said Keyur Brahmbhatt, a doctorate student at NIPER, who was a part of the study.
