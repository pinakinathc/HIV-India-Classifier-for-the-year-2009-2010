ALLAHABAD: In an attempt to offer relief to HIV+ children in city and dehat areas from the social stigma they face, UNICEF with the help of UP Aids Control Society is organising an exhibition of comics created by Children Affected By AIDS (CABA). These children were able to create comics following training provided by World Comics, India. These comics will be developed into panels and displayed by a Lucknow based NGO in the Sangam city on August 31. Dr Meesum SAM, assistant district programme officer, aids control, told TOI, "Health authorities are sensitising people towards feelings of HIV positive people.'' "Incidents of social boycott of HIV+ people are mainly reported in rural areas and we have been making efforts to apprise people about the actual facts related to HIV and AIDS," said Dr Meesum, adding that experts from UNICEF and health authorities are sensitising people on the disease.Last year, an eight-year-old boy, along with his cousin, was ousted by school authorities after the locals had mounted pressure on school authorities for the same. After a series of educational and awareness camps, the health authorities had managed to spread awareness and managed to make the villagers realise the trauma being faced by the victims. The officials of UP State Aids Control Society disclosed that till 2009, a total of 49,832 HIV positive and 10,072 AIDS patients had been identified across the state. District magistrate, Allahabad, Sanjay Prasad said, "Sincere efforts are being made to spread awareness about HIV\AIDS. Folk songs being performed by folk troupes have become an effective tool to spread awareness.'' On Saturday, a play titled `Shifa' will be staged at NCZCC on stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV\AIDS. The event would be held by National School of Drama, Delhi, Bhartendu Natya Academy, and department of culture, government of UP.
