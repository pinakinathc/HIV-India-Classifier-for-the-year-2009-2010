 MAPUSA: Wearing a lace would mean nothing to many, but for Indian football superstar it makes a world of difference.   Baichung Bhutia has joined Nike's RED campaign which asks all and sundry to lace up and save lives.   Some of the world's leading athletes have joined forces in the global fight against AIDS/HIV in South Africa. The famous names include Didier Drogba, Joe Cole, Andrei Arshavin, Marco Materazzi, Maria Sharapova and Kobe Bryant. And joining hands now is our very own Baichung Bhutia.   "It's a wonderful initiative from Nike. It's for a noble cause and I am pleased to be part of the campaign," Bhutia told TOI on Monday.   The RED lace campaign hopes to raise money for the fight against AIDS/HIV through the sale proceeds of red laces.   Bhutia, who happens to be the only Indian face in the campaign, promised his unflinching support towards the cause.   The concept behind the RED campaign-Lace Up Save Lives- is that the red laces which are being sold by Nike would see the total proceeds of the profit equally distributed between The Global Fund to Fight Aids and Nike football-based community initiative to fight and prevent HIV/AIDS.
