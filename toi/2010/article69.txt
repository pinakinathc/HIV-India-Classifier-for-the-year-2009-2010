 DARMSTADT (GERMANY): German pop star Nadja Benaissa admitted on the opening day of her trial on Monday not telling sexual partners, with whom she had unprotected sex, that she was HIV positive.   "I am so sorry," the contrite-looking 28-year-old told the court in Darmstadt. She denied intending to infect anyone with the virus.   Benaissa, a member of the all-female pop group No Angels, was arrested last April just as she was about to perform at a Frankfurt nightclub and spent 10 days in custody before being released. In February this year she was charged with causing bodily harm. If convicted Benaissa faces between six months and 10 years in prison. A verdict is due on on August 26.   According to the charge sheet, she had sex on five occasions between 2000 and 2004 with three people and did not tell them she was infected, even though she had known since 1999. One of the three had since been confirmed as being infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, prosecutors had said.   No Angels shot to fame in 2000 thanks to a TV talent show and had a string of hits in central Europe before splitting up in 2003. They reformed in 2007 and competed in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The singer, who has an 11-year-old daughter, has not yet developed the symptoms of AIDS.
