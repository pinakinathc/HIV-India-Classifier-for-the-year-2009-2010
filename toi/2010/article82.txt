 BIJAPUR: Vasudev Tolabandi, project director of Ujwala Rural Development Society here strongly opposed the decision of SDMC members of Belgaum-based Government Kannada School No 22 about keeping HIV+ students away from their classmates.   In a press note issued, he strongly condemned the attitude of SDMC members who supported the demand of parents to segregate the HIV+ students.   Tolbandi remembered that in Bagalkot district where a number of HIV+ students studied in different schools, were treated equally along with other students. Generous donors from Albal village comprising milk producers and Union members supplied 96 litres of milk every month to the hostel which was built for the HIV+ students at Muttur rehabilitation centre.   "Discrimination among the students is a very bad thing. It is very shameful on the part of the society as well. Hence it should not be accepted by the government," he demanded.
