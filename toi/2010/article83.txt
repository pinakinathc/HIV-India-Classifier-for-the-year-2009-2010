BELGAUM: DDPI V M Patil held an awareness meeting at the Government Kannada School No. 22 here on Thursday, following reports that parents have stopped sending their children to the school after learning that there are HIV+ students too in the institution. The DDPI tried to dispel the myths surrounding the disease. He told parents that HIV is not transmitted by sitting next to each other or sharing books or playing together. Parents had stopped sending their children to the school from Monday. Patil told the School Development and Monitoring Committee that the government guidelines clearly state that HIV positive students cannot be segregated from normal children. Moreover, the school cannot make public diseases children suffer from.Parents of the students, local social worker Sarala Herekar, former mayor Vijay More, BEO A B Pundalik, SDMC chairman Sunanda Kumbhargoudar and taluk level health officials were present at the meeting. The DDPI also assured parents and the school that a health check-up camp would be held every month. Teachers and headmasters will receive training on handling such situations, Patil said.
