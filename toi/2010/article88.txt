 While recent WHO figures suggest that around 40 per cent babies borne out of HIV positive parents are carrying HIV infection worldwide, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Banaras Hindu University, is striving to reduce the percentage to only two with stringent monitoring and management of such cases at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre.   "Out of 130 registered HIV positive patients (pregnant women) in the department, as many as 80 women have already witnessed safe deliveries," claimed Sulekha Pandey of department of obstetrics and gynaecology, BHU, during a press conference on Saturday. Similarly, around 13,000 pregnant women have already undergone HIV tests in the past five years after it was made mandatory by the department, she added.   Saying that HIV positive cases needed special care and management that included sticking to ART and follow-up medication of child-- if found to be HIV positive-- she also emphasised, if possible, breast feeding by such mothers should be kept minimal as per the instructions of doctors to control the cases.
