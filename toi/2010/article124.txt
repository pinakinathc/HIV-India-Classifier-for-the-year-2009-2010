 NEW DELHI: Working towards complete elimination of pediatric HIV, Naco is changing its treatment protocol for HIV-positive pregnant mothers.   As of now, women under the Prevention of Parent-To-Child Transmission of HIV programme are given a single dose of Nevirapine at the time of labour and to the newborn after the delivery. Now, Naco has decided that if the pregnant HIV woman is found to have blood CD4 count below 350, she will be put on a full-fledged anti retroviral therapy.   However, if the woman's blood CD4 count is above 350, she will be put on a more effective drug, Zidovudine, right from 16 weeks of pregnancy till the delivery. However, the new-born will be administered Nevirapine throughout the breast- feeding period.
