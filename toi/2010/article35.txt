 WASHINGTON: A non-profit that develops drugs against HIV/AIDS is launching the first study in Africa of a groundbreaking device to fight AIDS: a vaginal ring with a difference.   Where most vaginal rings deliver contraceptive hormones, the one developed by the International Partnership for Microbicides discreetly releases antiretrovirals to women who use it. IPM will launch double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled studies of the ring containing 25 milligrams of the new antiretroviral drug dapivirine at research centers in southern and eastern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is hitting hardest.   Recent data released by the World Health Organization show HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death globally in women 15 to 44 years old.   In Africa, HIV/AIDS is the single most important cause of disease for a wider range of women, aged 15-59. For the ring trials, some 280 healthy, sexually-active, HIV-negative women will be given either the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring, which they will have to replace every month during the three-month study.
