 LUCKNOW: When it comes to 'extortion', the Lucknow police, it seems, spare none. Here's what they did to an HIV-positive woman: Thrown out by her husband after she delivered her baby and was diagnosed with the infection, Poonam (name changed) had to write to the chief minister for justice. The police swung into action, but now they demand a price for finding her absconding husband.   The local police has asked Poonam to hire a vehicle and give them money for petrol and 'other expenses' if she wants them to locate her husband. Poonam was only 16 years old when she got married to Rajesh, a salesman in a local firm. She came to know about her positive status during delivery of her daughter in May last year. The husband threw her out saying that he did not have enough money for the treatment. Rajesh also kept the baby.   The hapless woman was also disowned by her father. She knocked at every possible door, but nothing happened. She then wrote to the chief minister last month. The CM's office directed State AIDS Control Society to help Poonam get a job and asked police to take action against her husband and help her get custody of her daughter.
