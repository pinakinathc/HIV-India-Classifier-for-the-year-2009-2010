 BELLARY: The district administration, in association with the district AIDS prevention and control unit is planning to introduce an insurance scheme for HIV infected people in the district very soon.   In the first phase, the insurance scheme, with public and private participation, will cover around 750 people in the district and the insurance company will meet the cost of treatment upto Rs 15,000 per year for each patient. There are 15,675 people who have been tested HIV + in the district. Bellary was once in second place as the state having the highest number of AIDS-infected patients but the number has since dropped to eighth place due to the awareness and precautionary measures taken by the district administration.   Deputy commissioner B Shivappa said details about the insurance scheme has been chalked out with the private insurance company and that soon the facility would be provided for the welfare of HIV patients.   There has been a decline in HIV infection among youth below the age of 25 in the district due to prevention, care and support services which have increased through non-governmental organizations such as MYRADA, Vimukthi, Nityajeevana, Population Services International and Work Vision.
