 NEW DELHI: The HIV virus is unique and requires equally novel interventions. Scientists are, therefore, working on various out-of-the-box drug delivery systems to protect women against HIV.   Imagine a cellotape-like film that once inserted in the vagina would melt away and disperse drug to cells to protect against HIV. Or maybe a flexible vaginal ring containing two anti-HIV drugs. How about an almond-shaped vaginal tablet that would dissolve and deliver sustained levels of anti-HIV drugs over several hours.   All these products have now passed initial trials, according to scientists who presented their early findings at the International Microbicides Conference in Pittsburgh over the weekend.   Most of the world's women do not control when, with whom and with what protection, if any, they have sexual relations. This powerlessness is most acute in developing countries where HIV prevalence is highest. Women's most urgent need is for a prevention technology which they control themselves.   In the absence of a vaccine against HIV, microbicides are the answer â€” chemical agents used typically by women within the vagina in order to prevent infection by HIV.   However, most of the research on microbicides till now has focused on gels or vaginal creams. But the world has failed to create a successful microbicide. In February 2007, trials of a cellulose sulphate called Ushercell was stopped ahead of schedule for failing to work. In 2008, Carraguard, a vaginal cream that was the first to make it through late-stage testing, failed. It was unable to prevent transmission of the virus.
