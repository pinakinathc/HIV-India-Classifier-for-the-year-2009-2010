Special Correspondent TIRUCHI: In a show of solidarity with HIV positive persons, a samabandhi bhojanam (community feast) was organised here on Tuesday, when a large number of people lunched with persons afflicted by the disease. Hosted by the district unit of the State AIDS Control Society and the district administration, the feast was intended to send out a message against the social exclusion of the HIV infected persons. Over 600 persons attended the feast, including several HIV infected persons. Senior district officials, led by Collector T. Soundiah, Superintendent of Police A. Kaliyamurthy, and Corporation Commissioner T.T. Balsamy, partook the lunch along with positive persons. Mr.Soundiah observed that the initial fears caused by the outbreak of the disease several years ago was yet to be fully allayed so much so that the AIDS was still described by some as a killer disease. Affected persons had to suffer social exclusion and even family members failed to empathise. He called for similar initiatives to dispel the myths about the disease in the rural areas. About 6,100 registered HIV positive persons were being extended treatment through the 31 Nambikai Centres in the district, he said.
