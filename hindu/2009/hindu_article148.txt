Staff Reporter COIMBATORE: Stop violence against women and children, Salma, Chairperson of the Tamil Nadu State Social Welfare Board, Chennai, said here on Thursday. Inaugurating a State-level training programme for non-governmental organisations at the PSG College of Arts and Science, she observed that though the government had introduced several welfare schemes for women and children, crimes against them were still rampant in India. One out of every seven HIV/AIDS deaths was a child. Child labour, beggary and increasing suicide rates among women were indicators to the plight of women and children in the country, she said. According to a survey conducted in 2007, more than 5.7 million adults were living with HIV/AIDS in India. The social, psychological and economic problems caused by the disease were the same in all the third world countries where the spread of HIV/AIDS was still prevalent. Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS still existed and people were not aware of the disease or the ways it spread. People living with HIV/AIDS were discriminated against. The plight of children who were denied education or isolated in their schools was even worse. They were not accepted by society or their own community members. They were even denied the right to have a secure family as most of them lost either or both their parents to the disease. Unless society changed its attitude towards HIV/AIDS and took efforts to understand the disease, it could not be controlled. Ms.Salma urged social workers and the non-governmental organisations to work towards eradicating stigma and discrimination related to the disease and preventing violence against women and children. Principal of PSG College of Arts and Science, Sheela Ramachandran, said social workers and NGOs should address the problems related to HIV/AIDS and initiate measures to handle it. The prevention aspect should be stressed too, she said.
