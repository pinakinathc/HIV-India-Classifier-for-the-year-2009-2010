VISAKHAPATNAM: The number of HIV positive and AIDS cases in the district has come down to an extent and more vigorous efforts must be made to bring the number further, Collector Sanjay Kumar said while inaugurating a two-day workshop being conducted by the AP AIDS Control Society here on Thursday. The number might have come down, but there was a possibility of people in remote areas were not aware of HIV and AIDS and there might be some patients also. Hence it was necessary to take up a vigorous campaign in all areas. Every one must take part in the AIDS and HIV prevention programme and the apprehensions and fears among the people as well as inferiority complex among the positive people must be removed, Mr. Sanjay Kumar told the participants. Positive pregnant mothers must be given health food and medicines to stop HIV from spreading to their infants. Additional District Medical and Health Officer and District AIDS Control Officer P. Rajendra Prasad said the prevalence rate during last year was 0.40 per cent in the district according to the HIV Sentinel Surveillance report and did not increase from the previous yearâ€™s figure. (If a district records 0.40 per cent for three consecutive years, it would be brought down from A category to B category. The percentage was 1.76 during 2004). He explained the various programmes being taken up in the district. Nearly 80 representatives from the Blood Suraksha, truck drivers, female sex workers, community care centres, ART Nodal Officers, and other related fields, District TB Control Officer B. Balasundara Rao, Assistant Project Director of DRDA P. Govinda Rao, Project Officer of ICDS Sunanda, Medical Officers and others participated.
