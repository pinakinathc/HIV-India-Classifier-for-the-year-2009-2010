Staff Reporter Kakinada: Scientists dwelling on the frontiers of human biology are still hard-pressed to find a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. People wonder why can’t the dreaded disease be prevented with all the advances made in pathology, drug discovery and related areas. But it is no mean task to sift through the voluminous data currently available and potential options to devise a strategy for preventing the virus from claiming new victims. Extreme variations of HIV virus, the size of populations and time required for clinical trials with the attendant cost factor are the major challenges being faced by those seeking a lasting solution to the world’s biggest health care problem, said P. Kangueane, Managing Editor of Frontiers in Bioscience, USA. Addressing an international workshop on ‘Grand Engineering Challenges’ organised by JNTU, Kakinada, here on Wednesday, Dr. Kangueane said genetic diversity across the global population was in itself a major complexity for scientists trying to prevent the afflictions of HIV/AIDS virus but they were obviously constrained by the maze of issues pertaining to the congruence of biology and informatics. But some success has been achieved on this front by a whole body of scientists specialising in research of proteins and genes. Dr. Kangueane, who is also the founder of Bio-information, an online open access journal, and founding member of Holo-Genomics Society, USA, said the study of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes hold answers to the most enigmatic health care situations human beings find themselves in and asserted that only a better coordinated approach of the medical professionals, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians and statisticians would help crack the puzzle. JNTU Kakinada Vice-Chancellor Allam Appa Rao said an important goal of engineering today is fulfilling the promise of ‘personalised medicine’ as each individual differs in his/her susceptibility to disease and their response to treatments.
