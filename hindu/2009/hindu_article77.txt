Special Correspondent HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh will become the first State in the country in AIDS prevention and control, when it has in place evidence-based and demand-driven action plans at the district level, said AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) Project Director, R.V. Chandravadan. At a stake-holders workshop where officials from 11 districts presented the new district-level plan of action, he said that until now, it was the State organisations like APSACS here that used to prepare such action plans following guidelines laid down by the National AIDS Control Organisation. Detailing the background for such a shift in the planning process, Mr. Chandravadan said experience of the past few years had highlighted the need for de-centralised planning so that optimisation of resources could be achieved for greater effect. Greater focus was needed on migrant labour, he said, adding that there was virtually no data-mapping and saying it was an area that needed improvement. APSACS was constantly looking to improve efficiency levels and maximise impact, he said, going on to add that very soon they would add six more Anti-Revtroviral Therapy (ART) centres to the existing 25 in the State, apart from also setting up 14 ART link centres. A massive publicity campaign aimed at improving awareness levels among people would also be put in place, he said. The campaign to promote the use of condoms in AP had already proved to be successful, Mr. Chandravadan said. While 4.5 crore condoms were distributed free of cost to people last year, the figure was expected to touch 5 crore this year, he said.
