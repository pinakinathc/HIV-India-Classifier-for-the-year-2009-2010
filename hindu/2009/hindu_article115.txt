Deputy Mayor K Senthil Kumar inaugurated the ‘CHAHA parents’ forum’ (CHAHA is an acronym from Children affected by HIV/AIDS- health and happiness for all), which was constituted by Nature Medicare Charitable Trust (NMCT), a Non-Governmental Organisation based in Coimbatore, here on Saturday. V. Sundarapandian, co-ordinator, NMCT, said that the CHAHA parents’ forums would function adopting a cluster-based approach to help HIV/AIDS affected adults as well as children at Tirupur, Palladam, Sulur, Avinashi and Sultanpet. “In these five clusters alone, about 275 children below 18 have been identified as HIV positive,” he said. NMCT would convene meetings of HIV/AIDS affected people and the general community in the clusters to reiterate the need to provide livelihood, educational, health, and social support to carriers of HIV. At the inaugural, NMCT organized a ‘samuthaya pongal’ involving public and parents of HIV positive children.
