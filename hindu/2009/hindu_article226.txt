Special Correspondent THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is perhaps their way of saying ‘Another world is possible.’ And they have done it with a video documentary. The ‘they’ here are sex workers in Thrissur, who have made a documentary highlighting the social achievements of their community. Produced by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), the documentary ‘Vikasanathinte padayil’ narrates the activities of a community-based organisation of female sex workers named ‘Sanghamitra’ that operates in Thrissur. The 480-member organisation, which was the implementing agency of the KSACS-sponsored ‘Suraksha’ HIV control programme among sex workers in the district, has grown into one that does much besides HIV control programmes and related activities. It has helped 120 of its members to start a zero balance bank account and another 152 members to get medical insurance coverage through sponsorship. It also conducts job-oriented training programmes and various self- employment activities for its members. The success story of this community forms the narrative thread of the video documentary that is scheduled to be screened for the communities targeted for HIV-control projects across the State. The documentary was released by Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy on Wednesday.
