Staff Reporter THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Speakers at a one-day workshop on ‘Post Exposure Prophylaxis’ organised here by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) urged medical practitioners to take adequate safety precautions so that they don’t accidentally get infected with the HIV virus while performing clinical procedures. A press note issued here said the speakers also urged doctors to provide the best medical care to AIDS patients — care that is comparable to what other patients receive. Doctors must use sterilised equipment. Surgical needles should be carefully disposed of so that they are not re-used. Doctors should be cautious not get pricked by used needles or by sharp surgical instruments so that they don’t get infected, the press note said. Additional project director of KSACS Rita Cross briefed the participants about the current spread of HIV in the State, the various programmes and services of the Society. Raju Kumar of the Indian Medical Association’s HIV/AIDS cell, Rajasekharan of the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram and Ajith Kumar of the Medical College, Thrissur spoke. The workshop was conducted for medical officers of government hospitals at Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts.
