Well Done: People look at a sand art made by Sudarsan Pattnaik on 8 Oscar awards for ‘Slumdog Millionaire’, at Puri beach on Monday.   | Photo Credit:  Correspondent BHUBANESWAR: While Indians are basking in the glory of the Oscar awards for Slumdog Millionaire and A.R.Rahman, Puri-based internationally acclaimed sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik has celebrated the success in his characteristic style. On the shores of the Bay of Bengal in the pilgrim’s paradise of Puri, the master artist has sculpted eight Oscar’s trophies with a 25 ft long movie reel. “As an Indian, I am overwhelmed with the rare honour that our nation has claimed. I wish to celebrate the moment and congratulate Rahman and the team behind the fabulous film”, said Sudarsan. Sudarsan and his team of students of his Golden Sand Art Institute took five hours to sculpt the concept using five tonnes of sand. The former world champion has participated in 37 international sand sculpture championships across the globe so far. Through his art, he has attempted to draw the attention of the people of the world on major issues, achievements and events. His initiatives to appeal for help for the Tsunami victims, save the endangered Olive Ridley turtles and spread of awareness on the dangers of AIDS have been widely hailed.
