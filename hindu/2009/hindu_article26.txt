Mistake from either side can lead to an accident. How it would be if one sets to travel thousands of kilometres by riding a bike blindfolded? T. Vijayakanth, an upcoming magician from the city, exactly set forward for such an exciting escapade. He will travel 3,330 km, covering 23 districts of the State, in 17 days on a blindfold ride. Objective of the trip, he said, was to spread message on HIV/AIDS and terrorism. The expedition of Mr.Vijayakanth and his 15-member support crew was flagged off by the Project Director, A.P. State Aids Control Society (APSACS), R.V. Chandravadan and personality development coach B.V.Pattabhiram here on Thursday. The trip is being organised by Rotary Club of Secunderabad Silver-Line in association with APSACS and TVS Motors Ltd. Mr. Chandravadan said the decision of the young magician was timely as there was a need to create awareness among people on HIV/AIDS and terrorism. Mr. Vijayakanth, a final year student of M.A.Theatre Arts at Nizam College, also aimed at breaking the previous Guinness Book Record created by magician Samala Venu by travelling 3,186 km on bike blindfolded in 1991. Mr.Vijayakanth said he was confident about the success of his trip. He will pass through 66 cities and towns and return to Hyderabad on January 17.
