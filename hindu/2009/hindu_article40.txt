Staff Reporter GUNTUR: The Kothapet police have intensified interrogation into the sensational incident in which a person injected his cousin with blood infected with HIV for spurning his advances. The police registered cases under sections 354 and 307 IPC against the auto driver, Ravinder Prabhakar who resides at Rajiv Gandhi Nagar and arrested him. The police said the man had been harassing his cousin for the past two years. Based on a complaint, the police registered cases against the accused and arrested him. Laboratory tests revealed that the blood was infected with HIV. However, blood tests on the girl revealed no traces of HIV virus and the girl was immediately given ART drugs. Doctors at the Government General Hospital too confirmed that the chances of HIV infection spreading was slim if the affected person was given ART drugs within two hours. This is the second such incident in the district in the last 10 days. SP Mahesh Chandra Laddha has warned that cases would be booked and stringent action would be taking against any one resorting to similar offence.
