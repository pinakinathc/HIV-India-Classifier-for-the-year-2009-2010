O ne of the most popular and longest running shows on television, CID is an example of how eyeballs don't shift when they get sustained quality. Director B.P. Singh says that there are people who watched the series during their growing up years and are now watching it with their children. Despite numerous family soaps and reality shows, CID still maintains a loyal audience on Sony Entertainment Television. The team has worked together for the last 12 years. “There is a leadership hierarchy among guys but no gossiping,” said Singh. Says Dinesh Phadnis, who plays Fredericks, said, “We are always cracking jokes on sets. We share our personal problems as well. Though we work with such a senior artist like Shivaji Satam, there are no ego problems.” Talking about the world record for canning an entire episode of CID, “The Inheritance” in one single shot of 111 minutes without a single cut, Singh said, “We shot that episode only in seven days. It was team work and support of crew members.” “We are now planning to shoot a non-stop episode of 150 minutes. It's a difficult task, but the team is determined and dedicated,” Satam added. Earlier the show was focused more on crime solving and had a serious theme. But now there are elements of fun and romance as well. “This is to cut down the tense tone. I enjoy my comic role,” said Phadnis. Jasveer Kaur (Kajal) said, “ “For me it's a dream come true. When I was in 8th standard, I used to watch this show and I craved to be a part of it. I learnt a lot about acting on this show.” ANKITA DHYANI AND SHIVANI JAIN
