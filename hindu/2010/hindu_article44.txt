Staff Reporter Thiruvananthapuram: A ‘Life Bus’ is set to tour the rural areas in Wayanad, Idukki, Malappuram and Pathanamthitta districts with a campaign on HIV/AIDS awareness. The campaign, spearheaded by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), is aimed at reaching out to the youth and the grassroots with messages on prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. The ‘Life Bus’ will tour the district in January and February. A State-level meeting was held last week to discuss the campaign and chart out modalities. Project Director of KSACS K. Shailaja said that the campaign proposed to convey to the target group key messages on HIV/AIDS in an easy-to-comprehend manner. Various arts and cultural troupes registered with KSACS will present art forms that will relay messages on HIV/AIDS. The focus themes will be HIV prevention and control, societal attitude towards HIV-infected persons and the various service centres run by KSACS for HIV-positive persons. The ‘Life Bus’ will also host exhibitions, magic shows and folk art forms. Several HIV-positive speakers will also travel with the bus and talk about their experiences. The Life Bus will tour three panchayats in a block daily. At the meeting, officials discussed the topics on which information needed to be disseminated. Those who spoke at the meeting included Additional Project Director of KSACS T.V. Velayudhan, Joint Director (IEC) S. Ajaikumar and Mainstreaming consultant, G. Sunilkumar, among others.
