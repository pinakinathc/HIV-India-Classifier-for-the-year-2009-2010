SHIVAJI RAO    The foundation stone for a state-of-the-art anti retroviral treatment blood bank to be built by the National AIDS Control Organisation will be laid soon at the Anna Nagar Peripheral Hospital here, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director Shambu Kallolikar said on Saturday. Speaking at the annual awards function of the Madras Voluntary Blood Bureau (MVBB) and the Association of Voluntary Blood Donors (AVBD), Mr. Kallolikar said the building would come up at a cost of Rs.400 crore and is one of the four banks that the NACO had planned in four metropolitan cities in the country. Only Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu had identified land for the purpose and the State had handed over the required land to NACO, he added. The State stood first in the country in voluntary collection of blood and 92 per cent of the six lakh units of blood collected in 2009-10 were through voluntary donors, he said. Thanking donors for giving the State the distinction of ranking first in voluntary donation, he said the government was trying to get the NABL accreditation for seven blood banks with the aim of making the State the first in the country to provide “purity mark for every unit of blood.” AVBD president R. Rajkumar said 42,240 units of blood were collected through camps held across the State last year. Following motivation lectures, 36 schools also conducted camps, he said. Mylapore MLA S.Ve. Shekher, Fire and Rescue Services Director R. Nataraj and MVBB president Meena Muthiah participated.
