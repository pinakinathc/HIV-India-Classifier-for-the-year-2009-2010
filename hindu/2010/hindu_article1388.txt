Members of the Karnataka HIV Sonkithara Sanghatane, an organisation of people living with HIV, on Monday demanded that the State Government stop the involvement of village health and sanitation committees and panchayats in the implementation of a scheme for the welfare of children infected or affected by HIV. The State Government recently rolled out a programme through the Department of Women and Child Welfare to help children living with or affected by HIV in Karnataka. According to the scheme, the Government will bear the expenses of basic food, nutrition, shelter, medical and related travel expenses, educational material and clothing of such children. The beneficiaries will be identified and provided support by and through the village health and sanitation committees and gram panchayats. Opposing the involvement of village panchayats and the committees, Manohar Elavarthi, a human rights activist speaking on behalf of the sangathane, told presspersons on Monday that by doing so the Government was only harming the affected/infected children under the pretext of supporting them. “Why should the village panchayats and committees be involved? Can't the information about the people living with HIV be kept confidential? Who will be responsible if the people living with HIV and their children face stigma, discrimination, social boycott and other human rights violations as a result of revealing their HIV status to the panchayats? ” Akkai, another activist said. To register their opposition to the scheme, the sangathane members will stage a demonstration in the city on Tuesday near the Mahatma Gandhi statue. Their other demands include provision of adequate food and nutrition to all adults and children infected by HIV, free, non-judgmental and quality medical treatment to all people living with HIV and involving positive people meaningfully at all levels of decision making, she added.
