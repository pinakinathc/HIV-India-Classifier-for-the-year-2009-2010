A three-month-old infant was allegedly thrown into a canal by its father at Bethavolu village under Gudivada police station limits on Thursday. According to the police, S. Bullabbayi, 35, was married to Chinna some time ago. The husband and wife, who were stated to be suffering from AIDS, quarrelled over a trivial issue in the early hours. Bullabbayi threw the baby boy into the canal. The parents, however, told the police that they threw the dead body. The police were searching for the body to establish whether the baby was thrown alive.
