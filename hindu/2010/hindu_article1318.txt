A scene from the documentary ‘Paurulara Parahushar!' — Photo: T. Vijaya Kumar    At a time when neighbourhood crimes are on the rise in a growing city like Guntur, a policeman, who is also a lens man, has made a documentary to raise awareness on some common crimes. The 30-minute documentary titled ‘Paurulara Parahushar!', meaning ‘beware citizens', made by K. Srihari, head constable-cum-photographer, is an honest attempt to raise awareness on common crimes, including chain-snatching, house burglary and some economic offences. He had earlier filmed documentaries on HIV/AIDS prevention (Brathuku, Brathikinchu), voluntary blood donation (Pranadata) and on traffic awareness. “I have tried to show the modus operandi of these offences and also explained the precautions to be taken by citizens and avoid being duped by criminals,” Mr. Srihari told   on Thursday. For instance, in a shot filmed in Guntur, Mr. Srihari showed how an elderly woman was relieved of her gold ornaments by two men, posing as policemen. While one person dressed in a formal dress stops the woman and intimidates her to relieve gold ornaments and pack them into a piece of cloth, the other man diverts her attention and hands over another identical bag. By the time the old woman notices the fraud, the men disappear. These kinds of offences committed by “Irani batch,” had been reported in residential areas. The documentary features the common methods used by criminals in house burglaries. Mr. Srihari also explains that women should avoid ornaments when walking in isolated areas. They should have a companion while visiting banks and shopping complexes and take precautions while leaving homes. Mr. Srihari engaged 19 artistes and shot the documentary in parts of Guntur and Narsaraopet.
