The All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has decided to stage a dharna here on Tuesday in protest against the State Government not refunding the excess bus-fare collected from them earlier. In a statement here on Sunday, Pramodkumar, district secretary of the organisation, said that in response to a State-wide agitation call given by students, the Government had in August reduced the students bus-pass rates by Rs.200. The Government had promised to refund the excess fares collected between April and August. But, except for the Bangalore Metro Transport Corporation, the excess fares collected in other parts of the State had not been refunded. On enquiry, the NEKRTC officials here had said that it had so far not received any such order from the Government. Such indifferent attitude of the Government had hurt the students. The AIDSO had organised a week-long agitation since December 9 against the step-motherly treatment being meted out to students in places other than Bangalore, he said. Students in Raichur would take out a procession and stage a dharna on the premises of the Tahsildar's office here on Tuesday and submit a memorandum to the Tahsildar, he said.
