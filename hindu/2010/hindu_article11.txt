HYDERABAD: Kirloskar Technologies on Monday made a presentation on non-invasive magnetic-resonance focused ultrasound system for the treatment of uterine fibroids in women for the benefit of hospitals in the city. This machine, imported from Israel, reduces chances of infertility and offers significant advantages over the existing treatments. The new technology will help women reduce the risk of removal of uterus, which is very high in case of surgeries. It will be available in Hyderabad hospitals in three months, Amardeep Sethi, CEO, told The Hindu. This treatment is expected to be a boon to women who currently undergo a rigorous procedure in the treatment for uterine fibroids. Women in the country are at a far higher risk for fibroids with as many as 50 per cent having fibroids of various sizes. He said a highlight of the treatment is that it does not require any anesthesia or hospitalisation for the patient. Hence, women do not have to undergo the painful trauma of surgery. After outpatient treatment, they can leave the hospital within four hours. According to Mr. Sethi, uterine fibroids result in more inpatient hospital days than AIDS, breast cancer, dementia. It is estimated that women lose 5-10 million work days annually because of this.
