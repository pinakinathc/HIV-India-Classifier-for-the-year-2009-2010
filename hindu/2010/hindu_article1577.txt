An HIV-AIDS awareness and blood and organ donation programme was organised jointly by the Indian Red Cross Society, the Nilgiris chapter and the Government Industrial Training Institute in Coonoor recently. The Chairman, IRCS, K.R. Mani, who was the chief guest, underscored the importance of such programmes in motivating the youth to be service-minded. The Principal, Government ITI, G.M. Anbazhagan, presided over the function. Medical practitioner Ravi Thilagaraj said that blood donation had become a movement and hoped that organ donation also would become popular in course of time. He added that medical science had advanced so much that many parts of the body could now be replaced.
