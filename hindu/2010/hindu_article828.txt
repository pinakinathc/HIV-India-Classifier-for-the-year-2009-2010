all smiles: District Collector T. Abraham, giving away the prize to winners of the youth festival in Ariyalur recently.    Youth should go beyond academics and expand their knowledge base while keeping abreast of the current developments across the globe, T. Abraham, District Collector, has said. Speaking at the valediction of the district-level inter-collegiate sports meet organised as part of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) youth festival on Sunday, he said the rationale behind the sports meet was to create awareness of AIDS among youth. “Only 10 per cent of the spreading of AIDS is caused by reuse of unsterilised needles. Ninety per cent is through sexual transmission.” Youth can play a crucial role in creating awareness of the dreaded disease among public, the Collector added. Mr. Abraham gave away prizes in presence of S. Tamilselvan, District Sports Officer and Ilangovan, Project Manager, TANSACS.
