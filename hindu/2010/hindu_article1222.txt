Collector C. Rajendran inaugurated the haemophilia and palliative care units at the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai near here on Monday. A.M. Ikram, president, Haemophilia Federation of India (HFI), Vellore Chapter, said that haemophilia is a hereditary condition marked by the inability of the blood to clot. This condition is caused when the blood is deficient of even one of the anti-haemophilia factors (AHF) required for clotting. Continuous bleeding would be there in persons having haemophilia, resulting in inflammation of the leg and elbow joints and blue scars. Dr. Ikram said the HFI imparted training to doctors in the haemophilia units at the nearest HFI Regional Training Centres. Sixty haemophilia patients had registered with the HFI Vellore Chapter. The chapter organises liaison between patients and hospitals providing treatment, and takes care of socio-economic support and rehabilitation of the patients since haemophilia patients were prone to disability. Dr. Ikram said that AHFs imported from abroad are injected through intra-venous mode into the blood of the patients, whenever there is bleeding. Since the factors are extracted from the blood donated by the public and pooled together, there was the risk of the patients getting infected with HIV or the virus causing Hepatitis-B if the blood of even one of the donors contained the respective virus. Therefore the haemophilia units had been advised to take all precautions before injecting the AHFs into the blood of patients. P. Megalai, Superintendent of the GVMCH, E. Sivakumar, Deputy Superintendent, P. Arunan, Resident Medical Officer of the hospital and K.S.T. Suresh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Vellore spoke. G. Bharani, diabetologist welcomed the gathering. Saravanan, cancer specialist, proposed a vote of thanks.
