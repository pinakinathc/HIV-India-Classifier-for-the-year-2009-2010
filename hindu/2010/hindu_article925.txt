Subrahmanyam    The survival of the human race in the future is hinged on environmental protection and greening the world, said Andhra University Vice-Chancellor Beela Satyanarayana while launching the annual programme of the National Service Scheme at the Andhra University Engineering College premises on Sunday. Making an appeal to students and volunteers of NSS to work towards a green, plastic-free campus, he said that trees were of utmost importance for protection of nature in all forms. Every human being must plant and protect saplings equal to his/her age aiming at nurturing them to see them grow, he added. Green trees were steps for development/growth and every person must take it as his/her responsibility, said AU Engineering College Principal G.S.N. Raju. The NSS Coordinator P. Ramachandra Rao said that NSS units of all colleges in three north-coastal districts, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam would take up planting of trees. The volunteers would plant saplings in Government Offices, schools, colleges, public places, along the road, in the adopted villages to cover as much area as possible under the green belt. Describing this move as one to improve soil moisture and lowering the temperature to ensure proper rains during rainy season in the years to come, he hoped that they would create a record in this aspect. In addition to cleaning and taking up other socially relevant programmes the NSS during its annual programme celebrations takes up blood donation and creating awareness among illiterate masses on several life-threatening diseases like HIV/AIDS.
