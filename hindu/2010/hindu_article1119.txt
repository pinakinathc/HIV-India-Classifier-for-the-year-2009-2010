“Sharanya”, a voluntary healthcare organisation serving the cause of old and poor patients free for the last six years, has decided to open a new health centre here soon. Announcing this at a press conference on the occasion of the “World Rose Day”, Chairman of the Legislative Council D.H. Shankarmurthy, who is the organisation's honorary president, said here on Thursday that a 10-acre land near Gajanur near here had been purchased for the establishment of a 10-bed well-equipped health centre. He said that while outstation patients would be treated at the new health centre, those from Shimoga and Bhadravati would be treated at their own places. He said that it was proposed to extend treatment to AIDS patients too at the centre. Mr. Shankarmurthy said that “Sharanya” had treated nearly 100 cancer patients in the last six years making the last phase of their life as comfortable as possible. He said that the centre was functioning with the assistance of one doctor, four nurses and one ambulance. He said that what made it possible for it to render selfless service to the suffering in the last phase of their lives was the dedication and commitment of its members. Explaining the significance of “World Rose Day”, Mr. Shankarmurthy said that it was dedicated to the memory of Milind Rose, who, though herself afflicted with cancer, continued to serve cancer patients with single-minded dedication till her last.
