STYLE FILES Dia Mirza Photo : Shiv Kumar Pushpakar Â   B eautiful actor Dia Mirza has worked with many big banners and is awaiting the release of her new films, some of them long-pending. Excerpts from an interview: It became possible with my conviction and faith. There were also benefits of my Miss Asia-Pacific title in the beginning. And of course, maintaining good relations in the industry does help in many ways.  It is my honesty towards my work, which cannot go unrecognised. The length of the role does not matter for me. I always try to give my best. I trust my role and do justice to that. Well, it's not possible to name any one in particular. I enjoyed working with many actors. They are delightful in different ways. Vivek has all his charm. Salman Khan is an amazing actor. With Arjun Rampal I have done most of the movies. He is super cool and Abhishek Bachchan is very nice. I am quietly working on various projects. Some of my movies got stuck, like Sanjay Gupta's  , and Soojit Sircar's  . I am just hoping for their release, so I cannot make any announcement now. In   my character's name is Siya, a free wild child who falls in love with a much older man. It's a beautiful story. I have no clue of its release too. I was lucky to get a chance to work with him. I have grown up watching him on the big screen, so I was very excited about his presence. The first shoot I did with him was a very sensitive and emotional one about the relationship between a father and daughter. He is a breathtaking actor.  SHIVANI JAIN
