COUNSEL:Commissioner of Police P. Balasubramanian addressing an AIDS awareness programme in the city on Tuesday.    Special Correspondent MADURAI: A 12-day workshop on AIDS awareness for police personnel was launched in coordination with the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society here on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, Commissioner of Police P. Balasubramanian said that in a society, the police personnel had a higher level of obligation to serve the masses. Police (men and women) serving at the stations interacted with people from all walks of life every working day. Despite facing several obstacles, the men and women discharged their duties round-the-clock in larger public interest. Under such circumstances, the police not only need self-discipline, but disseminate the consequences of indiscipline to people around them. “You must set a role model for people around you,” he told the gathering of police personnel. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) P. C. Thenmozhi said that the tasks of police personnel were so much that they had to maintain vigil all the time even while discharging their duties by setting high standards. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) V. Jeyashri said that the police acted as messengers to the society in different ways. “Instead of shying away from subjects of taboo such as HIV and AIDS, we should learn the merits and demerits of them.” Trainer Ayyappan from Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society said that the police were more prone to contagious diseases since they were exposed to different segments of people. In Madurai and its peripheries, about 25,000 people who underwent the tests were tested positive for HIV/AIDS, according to an official report. In 2006, 26 lakh people had AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Hence, it was essential to be on the guard and not be complacent. The workshop which concludes on March 20.
