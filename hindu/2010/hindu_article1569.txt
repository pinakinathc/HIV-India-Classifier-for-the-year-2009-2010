The District Headquarters hospital here has received a facelift with the commissioning of a new mortuary unit and a renovated blood bank, among other facilities, at an outlay of Rs. 17 lakh, on Tuesday. The mortuary unit had come up at a cost of Rs. 10 lakh allocated from the corpus under Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project, a World Bank-funded scheme aimed at increasing the efficiency of public sector health services. The unit, having capacity to store 10 bodies at a time, was set up in the block constructed with the help of the South Rotary Electric Crematorium Society and the NGO named Valam. The blood bank at the hospital had received three refrigerators for storing blood and ELISA (enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay) Washer and Analyser, an appliance used to screen the blood for blood-transmitted diseases. These facilities were created using the fund support from Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation. Apart from it, the building housing the blood bank was renovated with the financial support of Rotary Club of Tirupur Metal Town as the block was in a dilapidated condition for long. “We have carried out the renovation works including civil and electrical repairs, at an outlay of Rs. 5 lakh,” Assistant Governor of Rotary District 3202 M. Thiyaharajan said.
