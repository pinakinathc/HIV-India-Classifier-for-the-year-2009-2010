This is the second successive year the train that seeks to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS is making a halt here. The exhibits and the other modes of awareness creation used in the train are aimed at educating the public about the spread of HIV and steps to be taken to prevent its spread through counselling and treatment.

There are arrangements in coach number five for conducting clinical tests and counselling, while coach number six is meant for cultural troupes. The seventh coach is for providing refresher training to the local health workers and the eighth is to treat normal diseases like malaria and swine flu. Volunteers of various service organisations from different parts of the district put up stalls on the platform with charts and models on HIV/AIDS. Notwithstanding the fact that schools have been closed for summer vacation, many schoolchildren visited the train along with their teachers.
