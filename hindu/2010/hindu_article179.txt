Staff Correspondent Udupi: Oscar Fernandes, MP and Chairman of the Parliamentary Forum on HIV and AIDS, said on Saturday that although the prevalence of HIV had come down in Udupi district, there was no room for complacency. He was speaking at the valedictory function of the Red Ribbon Express, which finished its 19-day campaign in Karnataka, here. Mr. Fernandes said that the common perception that HIV prevailed only among truckers was wrong. Everyone should be made aware about HIV, he said. The number of visitors to the Red Ribbon Express in Udupi increased to 10,487 after 6,161 people, mostly students, thronged the train on Saturday. The train successfully completed its HIV and rural health awareness campaign with 1,28,982 people visiting it by the end of its programme, covering 11 places in the State.
