GIVING IT HER ALL Dia Mirza Photo: Shiv Kumar Pushpakar    P art of the model-turned-actor brigade, Dia Mirza has worked with many big banners and is awaiting the release of her new films, some of them long-pending. Excerpts from an interview: It is my honesty towards my work, which cannot go unrecognised. The length of the role does not matter for me. I always try to give my best. I have enjoyed working with many actors and they are delightful in different ways. Vivek has his charm. Salman Khan is an amazing actor. With Arjun Rampal I have done most of my films. He is super cool and Abhishek Bachchan is very nice. I am working on various projects. Some of my films are stuck — such as Sanjay Gupta's “Alibaug”, and Soojit Sircar's “Shoebite”. I am just hoping for their release, so I cannot make any announcements now. In “Alibaug” my character's name is Siya, a wild child who falls in love with a much older man. It's a beautiful story. I was lucky to get a chance to work with him. I have grown up watching him on the big screen, so I was very excited. The first shoot I did with him was a very sensitive and emotional one about the relationship between a father and daughter. I indulge in painting, writing, reading, pottery, horse-riding, and watching films. I am also associated with many NGOs. I am a fashion freak and completely up-to-date date on global trends. But I am not a brand slave. I like Gauri and Nainika, Shantanu and Nikhil, and Manish Malhotra. SHIVANI JAIN
