Special Correspondent VISAKHAPATNAM: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), as part of its CSR activities, handed over DNA-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test kits worth Rs. 3.75 lakhs to the Population Services International at St. Ann's Hospital here. The test will help diagnose within six weeks whether the infant born to a HIV positive woman is HIV positive or not. A Prevention of Parent To Child Centre (PPTCC) was established jointly by the YRG Care and PSI at St. Ann's Hospital to prevent children to be born to pregnant women from contracting HIV. At present, a period of 18 months was needed to know if the infant born to an HIV positive woman was having HIV or not but the DNA PCR test kit would help in finding the result in six weeks, thus reducing the mental agony and pressure experienced by the mother, according to a press release from the PSI. Executive Director of HPCL P.A.B. Raju, Chief Manager (HR) Nandi, area programme manager of PSI G.K.V. Ravichandra, Sr. Latha of St. Ann's Hospital, HIV positive parents and others were present.
