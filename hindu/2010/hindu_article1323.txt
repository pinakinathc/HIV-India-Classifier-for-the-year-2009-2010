About 500 young people will gather at the Don Bosco School in Gandhinagar here from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and dance together to express themselves against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), as part of a worldwide event organised by Restless Development (formerly Students Partnership Worldwide) in association with dance4life. According to a release from Restless Development India, Vellore, the event is part of a worldwide event in which tens of thousands of young people spread over 27 countries will use their voice and feet to make a statement against HIV/AIDS. “United by one cause and connected live via satellite, they will dance together for life in front of each other and the world. They dance to inspire the world and remind the world leaders of the promises they made regarding the Millennium Development Goals”. The show can be watched live through Youtube. The dance4life empowers young people to take action and to challenge taboos around HIV and AIDS. After being inspired and informed during the schools programme, young people initiated their own prevention, awareness-raising and fund raising actions to bring about real change. During recent weeks, about 10,000 young people from Vellore, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts have involved in this worldwide movement and have committed to take action.
