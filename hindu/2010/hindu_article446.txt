Members of the District Congress Committee staged a dharna at Ambedkar Circle demanding the arrest of Mr. Halappa as well as institution of criminal proceedings against him.

B.R. Aparna, secretary of the State unit of the AIMSS, said that Mr. Halappa had committed a heinous crime, while the Chief Minister was trying to “shield” him.
