Reaching out: Visitors at the exhibition on HIV/AIDS on the Red Ribbon Express II in Bellary on Wednesday.    Staff Correspondent BELLARY: Over 11,000 people, including students and sex workers, visited the exhibition on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, A(H1N1) and maternal and child health on the Red Ribbon Express, which chugged into Bellary Railway Station on Tuesday. MYRADA taluk coordinator Sumalatha said: “When the Red Ribbon Express came to Hospet in 2008, many people from rural areas could easily grasp information about the deadly HIV/AIDS infection from the counsellors. They also learnt about precautionary measures, and the support facilities available. After the second phase, we are hopeful of an enhanced response from the public, especially in the rural areas”. MYRADA is an NGO that has been involved in raising awareness of HIV/AIDS among the people. Special sessions of 45-minute duration were held in one of the coaches on the causes of HIV/AIDS, differences between HIV and AIDS, its prevention and the care and support available, role of NGOs and the public in preventing the spread of the infection and the need to fight against it. Members of various NGOs, the police, women’s groups and students participated in these sessions. NGOs such as Nityajeevana, Population Services International (PSI), VIMUKTI and MYRADA also set up stalls. They were also instrumental in motivating many sex workers and the public to undergo counselling and blood tests. District Health Officer Jayakumar said that as Health Department personnel were pre-occupied with the Pulse Polio programme, the services of trained personnel from various NGOs had proved invaluable.
