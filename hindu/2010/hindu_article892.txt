IN PROTEST: Members of the Bijapur district unit of AIDSO and students staging a dharna in front of NEKRTC bus terminal in Bijapur on Thursday. Â   Members of the Bijapur district unit of the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) and students staged a dharna in front of the North East Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) office here on Thursday demanding refund of charges collected from students while issuing bus passes. The agitators gathered in front of the Gandhi Chowk and took out a procession on the main streets of the city. The procession culminated on the NEKRTC main bus terminal premises. Addressing the agitators, AIDSO district unit president H.T. Bharatkumar said that realising the problems of students, the State Government recently decided to bring down bus pass fees. However, the officials of the NEKRTC have not taken any steps to refund the money back to the students, he added. He urged the officers to take immediate steps to return the fees to students. He demanded that students should be allowed to make use of bus passes on Sundays and other holidays also as they had to attend tuition classes and other academic activities. The agitators also urged the authorities concerned to arrange for bus services in every village of the district to facilitate students of the poor and middle class families to attend classes regularly. A memorandum in this connection was submitted to the NEKRTC divisional manager.
