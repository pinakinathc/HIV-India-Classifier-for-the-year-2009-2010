Pneumonia kills one person every 20 seconds in the world, and for every one person killed by it in developed countries, 2,000 were killed in underdeveloped countries. These were some of the alarming statistics given by office-bearers of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Vijayawada Branch, R. Venkateswara Rao and Ch. Mallikarjuna Rao. At a media awareness programme held as part of the World Pneumonia Day here on Friday, they said the deaths caused by pneumonia were many more than what people realised or even imagined. They said that the Academy of Paediatrics had launched the “blow away pneumonia” campaign to mark the World Pneumonia Day on Friday with the support of Bollywood director Farah Khan. The campaign supported by the medical fraternity, parents, schools and local communities across the country was aimed at creating greater awareness about the infectious disease the morbidity and mortality of which was not so well known. It was the leading killer of children under five years old. Though it was a vaccine-preventable disease, it killed over 4 lakh Indian children every year. Since it killed more children than AIDS, measles, malaria combined, the campaign was created to emphasize on the need for immediate action, they said. Two vaccines – Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine — protected children from two of the main causes of life-threatening pneumonia, they said.
