A competition ‘Go Creative' will be launched on December 1 in different fields of communication arts to spread the message of AIDS awareness in the State. Carbon Creatives is organising the competition in poster design, animation, photography and short film and it will be judged by experts in industry and media. Winners of the competitions will be felicitated on January 12, the World Youth Day, and will be given cash prizes. “The idea is to bring out the latent talent of youth and create awareness among them about the prevalence of HIV/AIDS”, said Sumanth Motha, promoter of Carbon Creatives.
