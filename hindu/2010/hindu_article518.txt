The Karnataka Network of Positive People, which was founded in 1998, was the first to offer a health insurance package for people living with HIV/AIDS in India. In other parts of the country such a form of insurance came into force only in 2008. The policy gives a general insurance cover to medical emergencies and IP services. The Karnataka Network of Positive People is State-level, community-based organisation, located in Srirampuram and has 50,000 people registered with it across 26 districts in Karnataka. The network's activities include advocacy, networking and services. The insurance policy or â€˜Star Net Plus' policy was introduced as a joint venture of Population Service International (PSI) and Karnataka Network for Positive People. Population Services International, an international social marketing organisation that has been working on health issues across 60 countries, provides funds for the insurance programme. In India, Population Service International works for various international and central government programmes. While the network's insurance policy is the first of its kind in India, the project has now been extended to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. For details, contact 23521915. Swati Kamra
