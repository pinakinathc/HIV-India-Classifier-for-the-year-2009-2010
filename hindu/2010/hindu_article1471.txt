Goutham    Various rights and non governmental organisations took out an awareness rally here on Friday to ensure all rights and dignity to those who are living with AIDS/HIV and other vulnerable sections of the society including transgenders. Carrying the message of ‘Not only doors of our houses but also our minds are open to Positive people and trangenders,' activists and members of various organisations including Centre for Advocacy And Research (CFAR), YWCA, CSI Polytechnic, District AIDS Control Society, Salem HIV Positive Network and TAI Vizhudugal, covered important pockets in the city and distributed handbills asking the people not to show any discrimination against the affected. Saying that showing discrimination against the affected people itself was a human rights violation, they pointed out human rights was common for all and highlighted the need to stop discriminating against Positive people and transgenders. They had sought the permission of shop keepers and auto rickshaw drivers to paste sticker bills carrying messages of ‘Our hearts are open to Positive people.' The participants also made the people to take pledge against discrimination, which was mainly due to lack of awareness. They also formed a citizen's group that had decided to help the affected fight against the stigma and shun discrimination. They also pledged to take initiatives to mainstream the vulnerable sections into the society. District Legal Service Authority Secretary and Sub Judge C. Kumarasamy, Joint Director of Health Services Dr. M. Gnanasekaran, YWCA Secretary Ruby Thiagarajan, CSI Polytechnic Principal M. Geetha Kennedy, transgender Gopika, Salem Network of Positive People Nagarajan and others took part in the rally.
