P art of the model-turned-actor brigade, Dia Mirza has worked with many big banners and is awaiting the release of her new films, some of them long-pending. Excerpts from an interview:  It is my honesty towards my work, which cannot go unrecognised. The length of the role does not matter for me. I always try to give my best.  I enjoyed working with many actors. They are delightful in different ways. Vivek has all his charm. Salman Khan is an amazing actor. With Arjun Rampal I have done most of the movies. He is super cool and Abhishek Bachchan is very nice. I am quietly working on various projects. Some of my movies got stuck, like Sanjay Gupta's “Alibaug”, and Soojit Sircar's “Shoebite”. I am just hoping for their release, so I cannot make any announcement now. In “Alibaug” my character's name is Siya, a free wild child who falls in love with a much older man. It's a beautiful story. I have no clue of its release too. How was the experience of working with Amitabh Bachchan in “Shoebite”? I was lucky to get a chance to work with him. I have grown up watching him on the big screen, so I was very excited about his presence. The first shoot I did with him was a very sensitive and emotional one about the relationship between a father and daughter.  SHIVANI JAIN
