A call to volunteers to display more involvement in checking the spread of AIDS was made at the World AIDS Day meeting organised by the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI), the Nilgiris Chapter, in Coonoor on Wednesday. Addressing the gathering, Management Consultant P.S. Sundar said that volunteers engaged in creating awareness about the disease should work with a missionary zeal. Pointing out that the task of creating an AIDS-free society was not easy, he said that since the observance of the World AIDS Day in 2009 about 18 lakh AIDS patients had died worldwide and 26 lakh had become HIV victims. Observing that of the 3.33 crore people living with HIV in the world now, 23 lakh were in India and 2.13 lakh in Tamil Nadu, he said that the Nilgiris accounted for 337 cases of whom 147 were under treatment and the remaining were getting care and support.
