The Collector, C. Samayamoorthy, flagged off the Tirupur-Erode leg of the State-level cycle rally organised by the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) at the Collectorate here on Saturday. TANSACS district supervisor S. Arivalagan told ‘The Hindu' that the event was aimed at spreading awareness on HIV/AIDS and the need for supporting children infected the virus (HIV). The rally, which initially began from Coimbatore on Friday, reached Erode on Saturday evening after halting at Uthukuli Panchayat Union office, Sasuri Engineering College at Vijayamangalam, SIPCOT Industrial Estate at Perundurai, among other spots, where the rallyists distributed pamphlets carrying information on HIV/AIDS to the public. They also disseminated the details of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre functioning at the District Headquarters Hospital in Tirupur. “From Erode, the rally will travel through Karur, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Thiruvannamali, Vellore, and Thiruthani to reach Chennai on the World AIDS Day falling on December 1,” Mr. Arivalagan said. Similar rallies taken out by TANSACS simultaneously from Kanyakumari, Ramanathapuram and Thiruvallur districts too would be culminating at Chennai on the same day.
