Several student unions have called for a State-wide closure of educational institutions protesting the government's failure in regulating fee structure in private schools and non-release of fee reimbursement funds. SFI general secretary K. Chandramohan, TNSF president, N. Narsi Reddy and representatives of PDSU and AIDSO said in a statement that examination centres of SSC supplementary exams would be spared from the agitation. They said the government was yet to release Rs. 2,083 crore under fee reimbursement scheme and they had constituted a committee of Ministers for restructuring the scheme and stop payment of funds. They said the government started English medium in government schools, but the books were yet to be distributed. Similarly, mess bills and cosmetic charges for social welfare students were not released for the last six months. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha also extended its support to the bandh call. In a statement, Kasam Venkateshwarlu, BJYM president, said that the government was ignoring the interests of students.
