: Two papers on HIV and AIDS Education / Adolescence and Family Education have been made compulsory in the B.Ed. programme of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). These two subjects were made compulsory for the working teachers who are pursuing B.Ed. course due to the importance attached by the university to health and family education, a press release from M. Shanmugham, IGNOU Regional Director, Madurai, said. “Schools are well-established points through which children can receive AIDS education at young age itself. Basic knowledge enables school teachers to educate the younger generation,” the press release said.
