Sundar MADURAI: Red Ribbon Express arrived here on Thursday on a mission to create an awareness of HIV/AIDS. But, it was also revealed that Madurai is no more conservative. For, hundreds of girls from various colleges queued up on the 8 {+t} {+h} platform of the railway station to know more about HIV/AIDS. Not only did they go through various multi-media literature, but also actively interacted with the volunteers, both men and woman. They showed eagerness to know various aspects of HIV/AIDS. They cleared their doubts on sexually transmitted diseases by listening to the recorded messages. National AIDS Control Organisation has adopted different strategies, from video clippings, audio messages and quiz programmes, for effectively communicating with the masses on HIV/AIDS. Map A colourful map of India had different colours of lighting from red, green and white to mark the regions according to gravity of prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Anyone who noticed the map would have been disturbed to note that Tamil Nadu, along with Andhra Pradesh and parts of Karnataka, shared the worst affected region in the country. In one of the coaches which was dedicated on the kinds of discrimination the HIV/AIDS infected persons were facing, a young woman explained that many HIV/AIDS affected mothers were separated from their children. Many of them were denied rights to have a share in the ancestral property. Pictorial depictions There were pictorial depictions to drive home the point that infected children had every right to have education in institution and no one could be sent out of work for having infected with AIDS. At the counselling centre in one of the coaches, separate enclosures with full privacy ensured that people could in person clear their doubts on HIV/AIDS. Free blood tests too were done for those volunteered.
