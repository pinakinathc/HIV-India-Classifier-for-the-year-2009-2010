After much delay, the Blood Component Separator machine, which remained underutilised for the past several months due to procedural wrangles, is all set for inauguration at the blood bank in the district headquarters hospital in the town. The sophisticated equipment is used for separation of the blood into various components like platelets and plasma besides white and red cells. It is considered to be an essential equipment in a blood bank for supplying the requisite blood component to the patients in emergency condition particularly those suffering from dengue. The new device was sanctioned to the district headquarters hospital a couple of months ago. The blood bank staff concerned were also trained in the use of the equipment. However, it remained non-functional till date for want of the requisite permission from the authorities concerned, sources said. However, the spurt in dengue and viral fever cases in the district has necessitated the urgent need for the blood component separator at the district headquarters hospital. When contacted, District Coordinator of Health Services Papalal said the blood component separator was sanctioned to the hospital by the A P State AIDS Control Society. We have applied to the Central Government for licence to operate the machine in compliance with the procedures and it took time for installation, training and inspection by the authorities concerned as per the stipulated guidelines, he saidDistrict Collector N Nageswara Rao will inaugurate the machine on Thursday, he said.
