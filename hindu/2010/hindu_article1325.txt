Setting a model for the rest of the State, 50 designer shops will be opened under the Kudumbasree Mission in the district. Kudumbasree Mission district coordinator K.K. Ravi has said that the initiative was aimed at exploiting the market potential of Kudumbasree products. He said that awards received by the Kudumbasree Mission in the district for organisational arrangement and utilisation of funds in the last three years stood as a testimony for the model work carried out by the district unit. Out of the 15,710 Kudumbasree units in the district, 2,400 were in urban areas. A Kudumbasree self-help group had been launched in Muvattupuzha exclusively for the HIV-affected. They were actively engaged in the waste disposal in Muvattupuzha town. Group farming undertaken by Kudumbasree was also most effective in the district. Pampakuda panchayat in the district had been awarded by the State government for being without fallow land. Mr. Ravi said that 7,000-odd families had been rehabilitated in the district under the destitute rehabilitation scheme. Besides, constructing houses and toilets for these families, Kudumbasree was also meeting expenses of their health care and food.
