Pichumani    In an attempt to create awareness of prevention of HIV/AIDS and HIV-TB co-infection, the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) conducted a ‘Ride for Rights' bike rally on Tuesday. Twenty-eight volunteers of Metal Men Club of Chennai campaigned in 21 locations across the city to spread the message about rights of the infected persons and prevention of HIV-TB co-infection. The campaign was organised along with the Association for Rural Mass India, Rotary Club RI District 3230 and Resource Group for Education and Advocacy for Community Health (REACH) in view of World AIDS Day. R.Venkatakrishnan, Rotary District chairperson (AIDS awareness), RI District 3230, flagged off the rally. ICWO Secretary A.J.Hariharan said nearly 50-60 per cent of the people living with HIV are also infected with tuberculosis. The bike rally, from Anna Nagar West, covered many areas, including Moolakadai, Koyambedu, Kellys, Saidapet and Thiruvanmiyur, before culminating in the Marina Beach. REACH Director Nalini Krishnan, who released awareness posters, said such community participation is essential to sustain care for people living with HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis is one of the major causes of death among such patients. Collaboration between HIV and TB care must be established and patients with TB must also be screened periodically for HIV infection. The Association for Rural Mass India's Director A.Bakthavatchalam said people living with HIV face discrimination more in rural areas. The posters released at the function would be distributed to libraries and other non-governmental organisations.
