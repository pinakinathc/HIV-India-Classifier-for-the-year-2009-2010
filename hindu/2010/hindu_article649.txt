For all blood banks, it is mandatory to run the collected blood through a battery of tests to determine its safety. The collected blood should be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, venereal diseases including syphilis and malaria confirmation tests. The recipients or their relatives should check for ‘screened' stamp on the blood units, which indicates that the blood has been subjected to the mandatory tests and is ready for use. “Blood banks should conduct tests for HIV-1 and 2. The shelf life of blood is only 35 days and customers should watch out,” suggests Andhra Pradesh States AIDS Control Society (APSACS), Joint Director (Blood Safety), Dr. M.N. Kishore. There are two types of tests on blood to verify its HIV status. One is ‘slide' and the other is ‘elisa' method. Many point out that a majority of the stand alone blood banks take up ‘slide' and ‘elisa' test because they just cost Rs. 100 and Rs. 150 respectively. “We have seen that both the type of tests have errors. There are other tests which are a bit costly but they are worth it because lives are at stake,” doctors point out. Another major myth surrounding blood transfusion is the window period, which is the time from infection until a test can detect a change. The average window period for HIV is six weeks. “There have been instances wherein relatives of the HIV positive immediately blame on blood transfusion for HIV infection. People should keep in mind that it takes six weeks from getting infected with a disease till a test can detect a change in the blood,” Dr. Kishore said.
