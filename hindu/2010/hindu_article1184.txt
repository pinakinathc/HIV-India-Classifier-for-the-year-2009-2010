Vedhan    Phoenix'10, a cultural extravaganza jointly organised by the Rotaract Clubs of the College of Engineering, Guindy, and Women's Christian College, was conducted in aid of HIV-affected children at the Union Christian School, Chetpet, recently. Around 1200 Rotaracters from various clubs in the city attended the event. The day began with a guest performance by Kumaran, a young drummer who had the audience spell bound. The event was then inaugurated by music director-singer-lyricist Gangai Amaran. Kick-starting the show was a choreographed dance, followed by pick up drop escape, variety entertainment, pro-show and more dance. These events were judged by TV artist Priya, VJ Sharmila from Jaya TV, Director Raj Kumar of ‘Asatha Povadhu Yaaru', and VJ Riyaz. Apart from these competitions, a short film contest was also conducted which was judged by Naga, director of ‘Aanantha Purathu Veedu'. The rotaracters took part enthusiastically and the winners were awarded cash prizes and gift vouchers. The event also witnessed the presence of actor Sriman and Divya Dharshini (DD of VijayTV). The highlight of the programme was the Pro-Show. The concert showcased three famous singers M.K. Balaji, Ranaina and Vel Murugan. The rotaractors were on their feet and moved to the rhythm of these singers. There was also a performance by Jeyaraj, a 12-year-old from Shelter Home for HIV affected children at Kolathur, who danced to the hit numbers of Michael Jackson. The programme concluded with a valedictory ceremony in which the Rotaract Club of Hindu College was given the ‘The Best Cheering Team Award' while the Rotaract Club of Ambattur won the Best Out standing Club award.
