Eggs, milk, plantain and cucumber are some of the other items for both children and adults. The modified diet, ordered by the State Government, was introduced at the hospital by Dean V. Kumaran on Wednesday. Resident Medical Officer P. Sivaprakasam was among those present. The Dean said separate diet schedules for adults and children had been prepared. It was in the form of a chart in which the food items were mentioned against the timings for breakfast, snack time, lunch, tea time and dinner. Infants For children, there were three diet schedules according to the age group. One was for infants aged up to one year. This section would be provided a special porridge if infants had diarrhoea. The other two schedules-cum-diet lists were for children in the 1-8 and 3-12 age groups respectively. Children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) would have a separate diet. One diet was for the 1-8 age group and the other for the 8-12 age group. Protein-rich food would be provided to all categories of patients, the Dean said. Dr. Kumaran said the hospital was also planning to buy chappathi makers from a company in Mysore. “We plan to provide more chappathis and idlis to adults. One chappathi maker can roll out 1,000 chappathis in an hour,” he said. The Dean said the Government had sanctioned Rs.36 lakh this year for the modified diet programme. An increase in the outlay was expected next year.
