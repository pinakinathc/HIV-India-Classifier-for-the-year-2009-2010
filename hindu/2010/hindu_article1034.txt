To oppose the menace of commercialisation of education and to discuss various educational problems at the university and institution levels, the All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) is organising the fifth State-level students' conference in Dharwad from Saturday. Several educational issues would be deliberated and future course of action taken at this three-day conference. AIDSO had called upon students to participate in large numbers. AIDSO would demand the Government to ensure scientific, secular and democratic education, universalisation of education and abolition of capitation fee. The organisation had demanded that the Government fix the revaluation and re-totalling fees that was within the reach of the common man, allocate 10 per cent of the Central budget for education, increase budgetary allocation for education in the State budget and take steps to solve the problems of delay in the supply of textbooks and hostel problems.
