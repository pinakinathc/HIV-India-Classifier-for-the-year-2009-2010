For the first time the government has proposed a State Blood Policy to eliminate transfusion transmitted infections and provision of safe and adequate blood transfusion services to the people. Surakshita, as the policy is termed, aims at providing quality blood with focus on voluntary non-remunerated blood donation. It is proposed to accredit all blood banks in a phased manner as per the standard protocols of National Accredited Board for Hospitals. Blood banks which are more than ten years old have to get accredited within two years failing which their license will not be renewed. The A.P. State AIDS Control Society has submitted a draft blood policy to the government and is in the process of eliciting the opinion of the stakeholders and prominent blood banks in this regard. R.V. Chandravadan, project director, APSACS said the stress will be on voluntary blood donation.
