Mental health was as important as physical health and treatment given at the right time would cure mental illness, Principal of Andhra Medical College and a senior psychiatrist G. Bhagya Rao said here on Monday. Addressing a press conference after inaugurating the Mental Health Week at the Government Hospital for Mental Care, Dr. Bhagya Rao said this year's theme of the week given by the World Federation for Mental Health was “mental health and long-term illness-need for continued and integrated care”. Emotional problems faced by patients suffering with chronic and long-term diseases like arthritis, skin problems and ailments like cancer, suicide tendencies in some HIV positive people, should be addressed to and treated. All general physicians treating such patients should also be trained to identify the psychiatric problems and treat them. If the psychiatric problem was treated along with physical illness, the recovery would be much better, said Dr. Bhagya Rao. President of AP Chapter of Indian Psychiatric Society and Professor of Psychiatry N.N. Raju, district secretary S. Radharani explained about the theme of this year's Mental Health Week. Superintendent of the Govt. Hospital for Mental Health K. Narasimha Reddy presided.
