A forum to promote donation of rare blood groups is to be launched here on Friday. The forum, ‘Uthiram,' is a joint venture between American College, Lions Club of ESA and District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, E.S. Thanghapaandian, District Programme Officer of the unit, said that the forum would aim to ensure that no surgery patient or accident victim died for want of blood. The rare blood groups include AB Negative, A Negative, B Negative, O Negative and A1B Positive. “Madurai is witnessing a high number of accidents with the Government Rajaji Hospital alone needing 80 units of blood every day. ‘Uthiram' will form a network of blood donors that is open to students and the public. It will also reach out to the surrounding districts,” he said. The organisation would spread its work through National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers. They would attempt to dispel myths on blood donation and spread the message that it was completely safe, said Dr. Thanghapaandian. American College Principal Chinnaraj Joseph Jaikumar said that a three-day event on blood donation was being conducted at the college from Wednesday. It was aimed at creating scientific awareness of blood donation among students. A major blood donation camp targeting 350 units would be conducted at the college on Friday. This would be open to students and the public. The event would spread awareness regarding HIV among students since adolescents were a vulnerable group. Around 1,800 students were taking part in the event, he said.
