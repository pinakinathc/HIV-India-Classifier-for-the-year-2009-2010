Raising slogans: Members of the district unit of AIDSO staging a dharna in front of the deputy commissioner's office in Bijapur on Friday.    Members of the All India Democratic Students' Organisation's (AIDSO) district unit staged a dharna in front of the deputy commissioner's office here on Friday urging the officers concerned to announce the list of students selected for government hostels. Earlier, the members gathered near Gandhi Chowk and took out a procession to the deputy commissioner's office. They raised slogans against the authorities concerned for causing a delay in the selection of students for hostels. Addressing the members, district unit president Bharat Kumar said that students from poor and middle-class families, who had taken admission in schools and colleges in the city, faced inconvenience owing to the “negligent” attitude of the officers in announcing the list. Even one-and-a-half months after the commencement of the academic year, the list had not been announced, he alleged. Some students, who had to travel nearly 80 km from rural areas, stopped attending classes as they could not pay the bus fare. If this situation continued, the students would be affected, he said. The members demanded that the deputy commissioner instruct the officers concerned to announce the list of students selected for the hostels and provide them accommodation at the earliest. They also demanded that the number of hostels in the city be increased to accommodate more students pursuing higher education in the district. A memorandum was submitted to in-charge Deputy Commissioner Jiddimani. The members stated that they would intensify their agitation if the authorities concerned did not take steps to fulfil their demands at the earliest.
