Majority of schools and colleges were shutdown on Tuesday with the bandh call given by various student organisations protesting against the Government's failure to release funds under fee reimbursement scheme, high fee charged by the schools and domination of corporate colleges in the Intermediate sector. While a few schools functioned normally, a few other schools announced holiday in advance anticipating problems during the bandh call. Some other schools were forcibly closed down by the agitating students of various organisations. Colleges also remained shut across the State. At RTC X Roads in the city, students burnt the effigy of the State Government after taking out a rally. Similar protests were held across the State in all the towns and cities. The agitators did not spare engineering colleges on the outskirts of the city too. The Joint Action Committee of student organisations consisting of SFI, TNSF, PDSU and AIDSO said that thousands of students were arrested across the State and cases were registered against them. The JAC leaders said it was unfortunate that cases were booked for democratic protests and demanded that the cases be withdrawn immediately. The JAC leaders, K. Chandramohan of SFI, N. Narsi Reddy of PDSU, Gautam Prasad of PDSU and D. Raghavendra of AIDSO said that students boycotted classes in 674 mandal headquarters. Activists of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged a protest against at the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) alleging that Intermediate education has become a big business and the Government was deliberately promoting corporate colleges. Kadiyam Raju and Kalyan, ABVP leaders who spoke demanded common fee structure for Intermediate colleges as private colleges were literally fleecing students violating all rules. They said 5,600 vacant lecturer posts in junior college be filled immediately to save students in Government colleges. They said the response from students was instantaneous.
