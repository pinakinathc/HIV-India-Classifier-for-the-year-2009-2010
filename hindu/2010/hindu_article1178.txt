T he Beatles made more than just music â€” they made history. And while there have been several tribute bands formed for them, the only such group to have been featured in the renowned Beatles Book are The Cavern Beatles. As part of their Magical Mystery World Tour 2010 from Liverpool, The Cavern Beatles will perform at the Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall, 7.pm. onwards, on November 6. As musicians, the Cavern Beatles have researched their parts meticulously, from chord shapes to drum fills, to ensure the music is represented as accurately as possible. The show not only replicates the music of The Beatles, but also their mannerisms, costumes and change in physical appearances. The concert is being presented in Aid of Mellow Circle, at the Prathyasha Home of Hope for HIV/AIDS-affected children. Donor passes are available at Landmark, Odyssey and Pro Musicals' outlets.
