Staff Reporter Thrissur: HIV/AIDS is not merely a medical problem. It is a social issue characterised by discrimination and negative attitudes. A seminar conducted by VOICE, a community-based organisation working for the benefit of sexual minorities, called for sensitive handling of social issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. The seminar was organised in association with Sangamitra and the Council for People Living with HIV/AIDS. Addressing the seminar, District Panchayat President Ambadi Venu said that discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS was a clear case of human rights violation. “The HIV affected often get ostracised from their families. Awareness campaigns and rehabilitation measures are needed to ensure the rights of such people,” he said. The seminar observed that many HIV/AIDS patients were being denied medical care at hospitals. Many are thrown out of their jobs and denied family properties, and these push them to absolute poverty. Biji K. Varghese, project officer with the Kerala Sate AIDS Control Society, pointed out that many victims keep their medical condition a secret for fear of being exposed, and of being expelled from the family and society. The seminar also highlighted the problems of sexual minorities. Social worker Fr. Varghese Palathingal and Assistant District Collector M.G. Rajamanikyam, also spoke.
