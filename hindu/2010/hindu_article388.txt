The mega event is being organised to support an orphanage for children with HIV/AIDS. Organised by the Chennai province of the World Malayalee Council (WMC), in association with Madras Medical Mission and Kairali Television, the sale proceeds of the passes for the event will go in support of the orphanage. Addressing a press conference in this connection here on Friday, actor Kamal Haasan, ambassador of the initiative, said medical attention was given to as many as 160 children in the last few years, thanks to the World Malayalee Council's efforts. “This is like a tiny drop. There are several lakh persons out there who need such support. We have a long way to go.” On the State government's initiative to provide insurance cover to the underprivileged sections through the Kalaignar Insurance Scheme, Mr. Haasan said: “We should acknowledge a government's good work irrespective of who is in power.” Veteran Malayalam director Vincent, fondly known as “Vincent master,” will receive the Living Legend Award at the ceremony, the actor announced. V. C. Praveen of the WMC said that the event will be held at Nehru Indoor Stadium from 5.30 p.m.
