A group of ten students staged a street play on the premises of the city railway station on steps to prevent the transmission of HIV. The play focussed on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The students also staged a skit in front of an assembly of pre-university students at SDM-MMK College for Girls here. JSS Nursing College Mysore vice-principal Renuka Devi told   that the college had been holding HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns every year. The students also gave information on antiretroviral treatment (ART) centres and community care centres for people with HIV.
