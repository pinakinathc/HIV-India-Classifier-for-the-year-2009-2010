Special Correspondent HYDERABAD: A committee headed by Dr Sucharitha Murthy, Director, Institute of Preventive Medicine, has been constituted by the government to study the functioning of the blood banks in the State and submit recommendations to streamline their functioning. Subbi Reddy, Joint Director, Drugs Control Authority, is the member-convener while there are five other members in the committee from the Health and related departments. The constitution of the committee comes in the wake of the recent incident in which a road accident victim was administered HIV-infected blood obtained from a private blood bank at Rajahmundry recently. The government noted that a majority of the private and government blood banks existing in the State did not fulfil statutory requirements or quality standards. A official in the Health Department said there was a shortfall of 2 lakh units of bloods in the State at any given point of time, and the scarcity was particularly felt in Karimnagar, Medak, Prakasam, WG, Nizamabad, Srikakulam and Adilabad districts. It would recommend steps to improve blood donations, increase awareness among people about rational use of blood components and work out modalities to provide information online about the availability of blood at various blood banks.
