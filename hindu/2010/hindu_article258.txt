Campaign:Skits performed as part of the AIDS awareness campaign in Cuddalore on Tuesday.   | Photo Credit:  Special Correspondent CUDDALORE: After ‘Pulli Raja' it is now ‘Dillu Dura'. These imaginary characters are intended to kindle curiosity among the people such as who they are and why they are projected. Both the characters represent the common man assailed by doubts about the HIV. With scanty knowledge or no knowledge about HIV the vulnerable sections are in a dilemma as to how to ward off the ailment. Therefore, to bring them out of the shell and to get treatment as in the case of other common ailments the Dillu Dura awareness campaign was launched in Cuddalore by District Collector P.Seetharaman. The campaign van was preceded by cultural troupes, who enacted simple skits to convey the message that tying talisman or trying some locally jostled-up remedies will not cure HIV. What is often disturbing their minds is whether they have actually contracted the disease and if so how to get authenticated treatment. The troupes advise the doubting Thomases to approach the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) to get clarifications. In the next 12 days the campaign would course its way through 13 blocks and 40 villages to cover an estimated population of 20,000. The organisers, including the district administration, the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society and the District AIDS Prevention Control Unit, are of the opinion that an informed public is the best method to understand the risks and come forward to access the services without any hang-ups. As on January 2010 a total of 48,965 people were screened for HIV in Cuddalore district and of them 741 have been put on the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) to extend their life span. Of the 49,916 pregnant women screened for HIV 59 had tested positive.
