Bashkaran Â   The main aim of the formation of Red Cross Society was to serve the people, said V. Arun Roy, Collector here on Friday. Presiding over the Geneva Conventions Day, he said, the society was established to serve the injured in international conflicts and in war zones. The motto of the society was not to allow anyone suffer unnecessarily. Youth should develop duty consciousness and a tendency to help others, the Collector said. Functions such as these would go a long way in creating awareness among the people in general and the younger generation in particular about the activities of the society. A large number of students, members of the Youth and Junior Red Cross, participated in the meeting organised by the district unit of the Indian Red Cross Society. G. Murthy, Chief Educational Officer, and M. Baskaran, Chief Educational Officer (SSA) spoke on the occasion. P.
