“The American” transcends the genre boundaries as it is not exactly an action movie; it's got a bit of the thriller element and drama too. This adaptation of the novel   by Martin Booth directed by Anton Corbijn is a subtle narration sans Russian mega-villains and world-ending schemes. Jack (George Clooney) a spy, when on vacation in Sweden with his lover escapes from an attempt on his life and reaches Italy. Under the instruction of his associate Pavel (Johan Leysen), he stays in seclusion in a small town and befriends Father Benedetto, a local priest. Pavel sets Jack up with an assignment to build a sniper and deliver it to Matilde (Thekla Reuten). As he works on the custom-made sniper, he befriends Clara (Violante Placido) a prostitute and gets into a deeper relationship. With his instincts buzzing danger, Jack eventually uncovers the scheme against him and takes down the people responsible for it. A plot that could have made for an explosive action flick a la Bourne or Bond has been toned down considerably. And the movie stands out for that very fact. George Clooney has played yet another amazing role and he makes full use of it in terms of performance. The alternating wide-angled and close-up shots add more feel to the subdued narration. The beautiful locales of Italian countryside and the chaste forests are another valuable addition to the narration. The movie is more of a case-study than an entertainer. Although inevitable in a movie of this kind, the slow pace makes the experience a little strenuous.  An assassin with a gun need not necessarily fire it. S.
