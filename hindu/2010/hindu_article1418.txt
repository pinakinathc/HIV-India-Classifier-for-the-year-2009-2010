I n an AIDS awareness initiative recently, Healthsquare, an upcoming diagnostic provider, hosted a unique campaign at South Delhi's Select CityWalk mall. Participants were asked to pull away condoms pasted on a wall in the form of the word ‘AIDS'. The thought behind this was that ‘AIDS' would eventually disappear (virtually). As an incentive there were coupons for gifts pasted behind each condom. This ensured that people kept coming by. Other activities in the daylong event included a “Healthsquare AIDS graffiti wall”, where Delhites shared their concerns and urged people to make this planet AIDS-free. An award winning public service advertisement, “HIV+ Have Rights Too”, was also screened to optimise the reach. This was awarded first prize amongst 120 entries in an all-India competition conducted by the Centre for Communication and Development Studies, Pune.
