A file Photo: Vivek Bendre    Following the Bombay High Court’s order for maintaining the noise level of 50 decibel during its Dussehra rally today, the Shiv Sena has decided to install noise barriers in central Mumbai’s Shivaji Park ground which falls under the silence zone. “We would have noise barriers across the ground at certain distance to maintain the noise level of 50 decibel. The party has taken help from technical experts to do so,” a Sena leader said. Earlier, the city police had denied permission for the rally citing silence zone norms, following which the party moved the High Court. The Court asked the police and municipal authorities to allow Sena’s rally at the same place but said the organisers must abide by Noise Pollution Control Rules, 2010. As per the rules, noise level cannot exceed 50 decibel in silence zones. Shiv Sena’s Dussehra rally, which has been a static feature for over last four decades, will have an added attraction this year. For the first time, three generations of Thackerays would share the dais as the party is all set to launch ‘Yuva Sena’, to be helmed by Aditya, grandson of Sena chief Bal Thackeray. The Sena chief was absent for the rally last year due to health problems and a video footage of his speech was shown. In 2008, heavy rains forced the party to cancel the rally. “In a grand function, the party would launch Yuva Sena, youth wing of the party which would be led by 20-year-old Aditya,” a senior party leader said.
