The state-of-the-art blood bank, coming up at a cost of Rs.400 crore, at the Anna Nagar Peripheral Hospital in the city will be inaugurated in a couple of months, Health Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam said here on Saturday. Addressing a function organised by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and Tamil Nadu Blood Transfusion Council, he said the blood bank and the plasma fractionation centre is being established with Central government funding. The function was organised as part of the National Voluntary Blood Donors Day. The blood bank was initially proposed to be built in the erstwhile jail premises, opposite Central railway station, but as the new building of Madras Medical College was proposed to be built there, the blood bank had to be shifted. A release from TANSACS said that there were 83 government, 165 voluntary and 11 quasi-government, Central government and two ESI blood banks in the State. There were also 90 government and 65 private blood storage centres. Thanking blood donors, Mr. Panneerselvam said the State now ranked first in voluntary blood donation, with 93 per cent donation being made voluntarily. Blood is separated into four components and given as per requirement. For instance in the case of dengue fever, the blood platelet counts falls and the patients must be given platelets only, he said. Distributing awards to organisations that had held blood donation camps in 2009-10, he said a directory of donors is provided to each taluka hospital to help patients' relatives to access information during an emergency. Prizes were distributed to winners of various competitions held as part of National Voluntary Blood Donors Day observed on October 1. Mayor M. Subramanian, Corporation Commissioner P. Karthikeyan and TANSACS Project Director Anu George spoke.
