An initiative of Road Transport Office (Madurai South) to teach road signs and basic traffic rules to learners while seeking LLR (licence for learners) has come in for praise. According to RTO (Madurai South) K. Selvakumar, during a recent visit to the office, State Transport Commissioner M. Rajaraman had appreciated the Motor Vehicle Inspectors and other personnel for taking such an initiative. The Commissioner had even instructed all other RTOs in the State to impart the ABC of road signs, among other basic rules, to be mandatorily followed by motorists in public interest. On an average, 60 to 70 applicants seek LLR from the RTO (Madurai South) daily. Prior to issuance of the licence to the learners, they are made to sit for the short course conducted by the MV Inspectors on all working days, which goes on for about 30 to 60 minutes, he told  . Those seeking licence for commercial vehicles are also taught the need for self-discipline by an instructor who deals with topics on AIDS and other related areas. In a bid to give an idea about the safety aspects to be followed by starters, the instructors present an outline of symbols to be looked for frequently and the preventive aspects. The RTO office, situated on Bypass Road, has huge posters displayed around its premises. The need to concentrate on driving, the consequences of lack of sleep and advantages of wearing helmet are some of them, he said.
