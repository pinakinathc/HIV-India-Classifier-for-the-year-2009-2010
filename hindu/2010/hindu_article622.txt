For B. Shenbbagavalli, Councillor of Chennai Corporation Ward 62, empowering women has been the mission and she has been doing this through the Anna Nagar Uru Mather Suyaseva Sangam (AUMSS). A society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975, AUMSS organises self-employment training, general awareness on business management and tailoring classes. Shenbbagavalli, president of AUMSS, says: “Women are achieving greater heights in all fields. Still, there are some women whose awareness level is low and they are in a poor state. The objective of our welfare organisation is to provide economic empowerment to these women. The society helps in educating them and providing them training to promote their own small business.” Ms. Shenbbagavalli says that AUMSS concentrates on tribal families — the most downtrodden lot in the society. It has also taken up several welfare activities for more than 150 tribal families in Parambikulm, which is located in the interior of forest area with little infrastructure facilities, by organising health awareness camps. AUMSS is also engaged in several other welfare activities such as running old age day care centre, organising health camps, providing educational help for poor students, helping leprosy affected people and creating awareness about AIDS and family planning. Though Ms. Shenbaggavalli has been engaged in various welfare activities through AUMSS, she does not feel loaded with the responsibility of being a Councillor. According to her, a Councillor's job is only an extension of public service. She feels that being a civic representative she is able to come in contact with common people and bring their problems to the notice of the authorities with ease. Be it a Councillor or the president of AUMSS, Shenbaggavalli has been in the forefront to fight for the cause of women. R. SRIKANTH
