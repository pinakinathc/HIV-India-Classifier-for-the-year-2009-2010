The Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), which caters to healthcare needs of workers in the organised sector, will soon reach out to unorganised workers in the area of HIV care in five States of the country. The Union Ministry of Labour and Employment recently approved the new HIV care and prevention initiative, which is to be implemented by the ESIC in five States, including Karnataka. It will be taken up in association with Round 9, a global funding project that works in the area of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Expected to be launched in April 2011, preparations for its implementation are likely to get under way by October this year, Shyama Goyal, Director, Family Welfare and HIV-ESIC, told  . Unorganised workforce, in sectors such as mining, textiles and construction, will be covered through onsite projects. The other States to be covered under it are Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. “We expect to receive guidelines on it by October and start consultations. Hiring for units, training and so on will follow once the funds come in,” said Dr. Goyal. The initiative, to be implemented over three years, will involve 35 interventions, each reaching out to 10,000 unorganised workers, she said. The project is extendable up to five years. The model for the new initiative is the Sankalp Project being implemented in some districts of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, jointly by Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust and ESIC. Here, the project is being implemented in Bangalore and Dakshina Kannada districts.
