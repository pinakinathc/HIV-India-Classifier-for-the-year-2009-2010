Creating awareness: A hug says it all. Photo: M. Karunakaran    Recently, a group of youngsters were seen holdings placards being stationed at six busy spots in the city. The cards held high above in their hands read “Free Hugs”. They were part of the campaign conducted to create awareness about AIDS. The campaign, conducted on The International Free Hugs Day, (July 3) was met with mixed reaction from the crowd. Some were bewildered and some amused, while some hurried away shyly, on being approached by the campaigners extending a warm hug. Initially people were reluctant to hug them back, but slowly more people came forward. “At least 40 per cent of the people don't know that AIDS doesn't spread by touching the patient. Two years ago, even I didn't know this. We should not shun people suffering from AIDS, they just happened to be unlucky in their lives,” said Asish Gupta, one of the campaigners. “Our aim is to give the message that AIDS doesn't spread by touching. By hugging random persons on the streets we are just highlighting this point,” said Dev Parvani, another campaigner. Karthick Sundar, the organiser of the event, was surprised at the media attention received by the campaign. “I didn't expect the media to give this much importance to the campaign. This is encouraging and will help in the success of the campaign,” he said. The Free Hugs campaign, the brain child of Juan Mann (known only by this pseudonym) — an Australian, is conducted by gifting hugs to strangers on the street. It is seen as an effort to make others feel better.
