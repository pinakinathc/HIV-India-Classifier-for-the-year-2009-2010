Opposition to the State Government's decision to allot over 20 acres of land belonging to the Veterinary College in Hebbal to construct houses for members of the judiciary appears to be gathering steam, with the Yuva Janata Dal (United) and All-India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) also voicing their ire. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, president of the State unit of the Yuva Janata Dal (U) K.C. Shivanand said that the Government's decision seems to have been taken with the intention of “pleasing” the judiciary. “But, the decision is anti-people and anti-student,” he alleged. Urging the Government to rescind the decision, Mr. Shivanand said the Government should allow the college, which is part of the Karnataka Veterinary Animal and Fisheries Sciences University, to use its land for research and other field activities. Mr. Shivanand said that party activists and students would hold a demonstration on the college premises, if the Government did not withdraw its decision by December 30. Appeal Meanwhile, the Karnataka State Committee for AIDSO has appealed to the judicial community to reject the Veterinary University land and demand that the Government build houses for judges elsewhere. In a press statement, AIDSO president Rajashekar V.N. has condemned the “autocratic” decision of the State Cabinet to “forcibly grab 20 acres of land” from the Veterinary University and allot the same to construct houses for members of the judiciary.
