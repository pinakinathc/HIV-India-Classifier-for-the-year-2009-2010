Scope International on Thursday launched its HIV/AIDS awareness and eye screening camp for school students at the Government Higher Secondary School in Sholinganallur. Health Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam launched the initiative of the multinational company, with an appeal to corporates to supplement the novel initiatives of the State government to improve healthcare. Volunteers from Scope International said the company had launched many initiatives as part of its outreach programmes, including the recent construction of a Rs.1.5 crore-building for a government primary school in Kunrathur. They said other schemes included Living with HIV and Seeing is Believing, launched in Chennai at the Sholinganallur school on Thursday. Living with HIV was a programme designed to “empower people through education to make informed lifestyle choices.” Volunteers said they would be reaching to all students of the school, creating awareness among them of HIV/AIDS. The objective was to reach out to all schools in the city and neighbouring districts. Arvind Ramesh, Sholinganallur town panchayat chairman, P.C.R. Suresh, senior vice-president, Scope International, and R. Jothilakshmi, school headmistress, spoke.
