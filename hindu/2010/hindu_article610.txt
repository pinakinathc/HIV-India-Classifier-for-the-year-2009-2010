FOR TEXTBOOKS: Students, who gathered under the aegis of AIDSO, staging a protest in Bangalore on Wednesday. — Photo: Sampath Kumar G.P.    Activists of the All India Students Democratic Organisation (AIDSO) and parents on Wednesday staged a protest here demanding that the Government ensure immediate supply textbooks. The inadequate supply of textbooks has affected students, especially those in classes VII and X, which are two grades that are considered crucial in the education system, the activists said. Demanding the termination of contracts given to printers, they urged the Government to solve the problem. Shobha Shivalingaiah, an enraged parent, participating in the protest, said: “Even though the Government has all the information about the students and the number of schools throughout the State, it has failed to take steps to improve the situation.” The Government Press, which was shut down after reporting losses, can be used for printing textbooks, she said. She also pointed out that the parents have to go through inconvenience as they are forced to hunt for old books and get them photocopied. Meanwhile, the Karnataka Publishers and Book Sellers Association has blamed the Government for the confusion. “On the one hand, the Government wants to distribute the books free in government and aided institutions, while, on the other, it has made arrangements to sell textbooks through schools in unaided institutions,” a memorandum submitted to the Primary and Secondary Education Minister said. This system of selling books, which has replaced the earlier system of allowing private book sellers to sell books to unaided schools, has rendered book sellers across the State job less.
