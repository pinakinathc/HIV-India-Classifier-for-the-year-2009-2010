A group of hijras waiting to submit a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Amlan Aditya Biswas in Chitradurga on Saturday.    Staff Correspondent Chitradurga: “We do not get to live a dignified life. Despite having parents, we are forced to live like orphans, as they feel we are a curse.” This was the sentiment expressed by Noori, a hijra, who was one among the dozen, who had come to submit a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Amlan Aditya Biswas seeking houses under the Ashraya scheme as well as other facilities. Speaking to The Hindu here on Saturday, Noori said that transgenders were living in pathetic conditions. She said that as people did not give them jobs, they were forced to beg. Dimple, another hijra, said: “Most of the time, landlords do not rent their houses out rent. Where should we go?” The group urged the Government to allot houses under the Ashraya scheme, provide BPL cards and medical facilities. Syed Akbar, who has AIDS, said his parents had forsaken him. Saying that he was with an NGO, he pointed out that he had submitted several memorandums to officials seeking financial aid for treatment. “None of them has helped me. I live with the hijras, who offer me food and shelter,” he said.
