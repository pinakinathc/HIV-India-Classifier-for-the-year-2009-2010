World Voluntary Blood Donation Day will be observed on June 14, C. Jamal Basha, MD (Hospital Administration) in RIMS hospital here said on Sunday. Donating one unit of blood can help save a life, he said and recalled that a scientist Dr. James Blunded injected the blood of one person to save another person's life as way back as in 1818. The first ever blood bank in the world was set up by Norman Bethun in Spain in 1936 and the first one in India was in Jadhavpur University in 1962. However, the voluntary blood donation concept was launched by one Balan in Jamshedpur in Bihar in 1939, Dr. Basha said. Dr. Lundstein classified blood of different types into A, B, AB and O groups in 1901 and Dr. Venus discovered the Rh factor in 1940, Dr. Jamal Basha said. The blood groups are of positive and negative type and a person having a specific blood group should be given the same blood group, he said. Persons over 18 years and under 60 years could donate blood provided their body weight is beyond 45 kg. and their haemoglobin level at least 12.50. The body temperature of an eligible donor must be above 37 degrees C, pulse rate between 70 and 80 and blood pressure must be normal. Those suffering from Hepatitis B or C, malaria, HIV, cancer and tuberculosis should not donate blood, he stated. Any healthy person can donate blood once in three months. After taking rest for sometime, consuming a fruit juice, milk or breakfast, one can go about with their routine chores. Stating that blood donation was the noblest form of donation that can save the life of a critically ill or needy person, Dr. Jamal Basha called upon healthy people to donate blood voluntarily.
