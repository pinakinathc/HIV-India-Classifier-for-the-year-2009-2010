Noble mission: The youths, who give a decent burial to the unclaimed bodies in Salem. — Photo: E. Lakshmi Narayanan    A group of underprivileged youths have turned Good Samaritans for those abandoned unfortunates who die all alone on the pavements and road-sides in Salem. This tiny group of seven friends sets aside a portion of their hard-earned money, which they eke out as mechanics and autorickshaw drivers, only to give a decent burial to the dead who have been rejected and abandoned on the streets by their near and dear. The friends, who undertake this humane job under the banner Oli Arakattalai Nanbargal (Light Trust Friends) in a humble manner since May 2009, have so far performed final rites to 99 – all from their own money. Today if the police find any unclaimed body in their jurisdiction, they immediately call them for the last rites after clearing all legal formalities. “For a corpse, we spend Rs. 1,100, including Rs. 400 for ambulance and Rs. 200 towards the expenses for last rites at the burial ground,” says K. Palanisamy, a two-wheeler mechanic. In fact, his friends in this noble cause – J. Kamaraj, M. Sridhar, P. Perumal, G. Balakrishnan, S. Pushpanathan and R. Sundarraj – are either auto mechanics or autorickshaw drivers. All of them are in the age group of 20 to 30. They have even handled the bodies of two who died of AIDS. They have approached the Salem Corporation asking it to waive the fees for burying the unclaimed bodies while the wealthy, they wish, could provide them ambulance service free of cost. “It will bring down the cost enormously,” they point out. The selfless service of these do-gooders restores the dignity of those who died in neglect – of course, beyond the grave.
