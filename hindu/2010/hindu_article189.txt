Staff Correspondent BELLARY: The two-day State-level conference of the Medical Services Centre will commence here on March 27. Speaking to presspersons here on Sunday, conference organising secretary Vasudhendra expressed grave concern over the fast-deteriorating healthcare system in the country due to authoritiesâ€™ apathy and certain policy decisions. He said that it was not diseases such as A(H1N1) influenza and AIDS that were taking a heavy toll on the people, but preventable diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera and malaria. Lack of potable water, malnutrition and inadequate public healthcare facilities in rural and urban areas had made people vulnerable to a host of illnesses, he said. Keeping these aspects in mind, participants at the conference would discuss issues such as the need to allocate at least ten per cent of the budget to health, the need to stop commercialisation and privatisation of healthcare, medical and paramedical education and scrap the policy on private-public partnerships in the health sector, and job security for all categories of health personnel. They would also discuss ways of improving and upgrading the healthcare delivery system at all levels and the implementation of comprehensive, and scientific education and research for the improvement of indigenous systems of medicine, besides steps to control dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis and other infectious diseases, he said. Around 300 delegates of all systems of medicine, medical students, nurses, pharmacists and other paramedical professionals, from across the State are expected to take part in the conference, he said.
