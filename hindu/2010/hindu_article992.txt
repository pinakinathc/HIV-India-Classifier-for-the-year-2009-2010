Responding to the allegations of forceful HIV testing by NGOs Suraksha and Sadhane on its staff, the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) has set up an inquiry committee to probe the mater. At a press conference held in the city recently, more than 90 staff members of the two organisations alleged they were made to forcibly undergo tests in the districts of Bangalore Urban and Rural, Dharwad, Ramanagaram and Chickballapur. Starting the probe, members of the enquiry committee — Maya Mascarenhas, Head of NGO Myrada; John Anthony, Head of Technical Support Unit of KSAPS; Vijay Hugar from KSAPS along with a documentation person — visited Suraksha and Sadhane offices in Ramanagaram and Channapatna districts. The team met about 45 members of the NGO individually and in groups and took the signatures of those staff `who alleged that they were tested forcefully. Mr. Anthony told   that the committee would submit its report to KSAPS in the next 10 days after which it would be forwarded to the National AIDS Control organisation.
