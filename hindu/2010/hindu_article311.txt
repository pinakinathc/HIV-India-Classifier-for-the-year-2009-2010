VIZIANAGARAM: The coordination committee on HIV/AIDS and TB has underscored the need to test patients for TB as well as HIV because patients are prone to be afflicted with either of the two or both the diseases. Collector G. Ram Narayana Reddy, who chaired the meeting, on Wednesday instructed doctors to test patients for both the diseases and prescribe medicines for HIV and TB. District TB Control Officer T. Rama Rao said 8.7 per cent of the 97 per cent of TB patients tested HIV positive. Additional DMHO and District AIDS Control Officer S. Chandra Reddy said that 263 patients tested up to last month were suffering from both HIV and TB in the district.
