Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday termed the incident, in which some Thalassemia patients at the Ummaid hospital in Jodhpur reportedly got infected with HIV due to tainted blood transfusions, as an act of gross medical negligence and said that it was up to the State government to take action on the issue. “We always make it sure and tell the State governments that they should have to see and test before any blood transfusions,” he told media persons at the airport here before his return to Delhi. Regarding assistance to the victims, he was of the view that nothing could be done beyond providing treatment to the affected persons, also adding that they could be treated free of cost in any of 5,000 centres across the country. On the Kashmir issue, he said the PCC chief and its other office-bearers were actively taking part in the all-party meeting convened by the Chief Minister and criticized the PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti for abstaining from the political initiative to restore peace in the state. He also praised the efforts of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in addressing and resolving the issues of the people. He extended his full support for the ruling National Conference party.
