Union Minister of State for Human Resources Development D. Purandeswari on Tuesday said it was high time that sufficient importance was attached to making safe blood available to the millions who needed it, whether it was in the aftermath of a national calamity or for routine surgeries in hospitals. Inaugurating the first national conference on ‘Voluntary Blood Donation' here, she asked, “Do we see an emphasis on blood donation as much as safe sex? Our publicity strategies need to re-looked and re-worked.” She said if awareness was improved, much higher levels of voluntary donation could be achieved to help the needy, especially considering the population of the country. Joint Secretary, National AIDS Control Organisation, Aradhana Joshi, said efforts were on to establish blood banks to handle one lakh litres of blood at all the metropolitan cities. She said that work was on to prepare a draft plan taking issues like inventory and supply chain management into consideration.
