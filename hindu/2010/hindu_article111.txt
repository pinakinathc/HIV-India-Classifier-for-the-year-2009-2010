Staff Reporter GUNTUR: Director General, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), K. Chandramouli on Monday said that there was an alarming rise in incidences of HIV/AIDS in district, despite the target intervention programmes. The latest sentinel surveillance reports reveal that the district is still placed among the vulnerable group in the country. The newly introduced Link Workers Scheme being operated in 180 districts would ensure better delivery of services, he said. The Director General, flanked by Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society Project Director R.V. Chandravadan, District Collector B. Ramanjaneyulu and other officers inspected the Ante Retroviral Therapy Centre on the premises of Government General Hospital, where he interacted with the doctors, line workers and people living with HIV-AIDS (PLHA). Later at a meeting held at Shushruta Hall, Mr. Chandramouli appealed to all the Government and NGO agencies working in HIV-AIDS projects to work hard in rural areas. The Project Director said that recent surveys have shown a rise in the number of sex workers in the district. The district has presently 8,000 sex workers. The Collector appealed to the DG to explore the possibility of giving a monthly pension to PLHA and those taking treatment at ART centres. GGH Superintendent D. Phanibhushan, DMHO M. Gopi Nayak and additional DMHO P. Uma Devi were present.
