A revised migration strategy is on the anvil to counter the AIDS threat posed by migrants. The plan aims at tackling the problem at the source of migration itself. In about a month's time the APSACS will implement the migration strategy in the State. In migration, particularly from North East States, UP and Bihar is posing a big challenge. With Andhra Pradesh becoming a high growth centre, opportunities have opened up especially in service sector and construction industry. Both skilled and semi skilled persons are heading here in droves and some bringing along the HIV virus. The greatest threat is from the single migrants who come to the State minus their families. “We plan to create awareness about AIDS at the point of migration. The idea is to promote good health seeking behaviour among the migrants,” says R.V. Chandravadan, project director, APSACS. Without being complacent at the declining HIV prevalence, he plans to intensify mainstreaming of HIV prevention efforts with all departments. The APSACS is looking at a multi-sector intensified response since HIV has a cross cutting influence on all segments. A new innovative campaign is also underway with focus on prevention. High risk groups like female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSMs), intravenous drug users (IDUs) and long distance truckers (LDTs) continue to be cause for concern. Targeted interventions are being planned on the basis of the scientific mapping of HRG carried out recently. Close interaction with civil society and people living with and affected by HIV, it is believed, will help prevent new infections and produce measurable impacts. While protecting the most affected persons, efforts are on to promote human and gender rights. The strategy is to build on the gains and focus on the emerging areas of concern. “Sustained efforts coupled with innovative strategies will pay off,” says Mr. Chandravadan.
