The district administration decided to take up AIDS awareness campaign in a different way as many people are averse to coming forward for HIV test fearing social boycott particularly in villages. As per the new strategy, all the patients who are suffering from tuberculosis and other chronic diseases will be tested to know whether they are affected by HIV too. According to doctors, HIV and AIDs patients will be affected by TB and other diseases within no time. However, they take medicines only for TB but not for HIV and AIDS, leading to further complications. Additional Joint Collector T.Baburao Naidu and Additional District Medical and Health Officer G.Ratna Kumari who organized a meeting with NGOs asked them to convince construction workers and fishermen who come under high risk groups. All the TB cases will be referred to 18 AIDS Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the district so that it would be easy for the Medical and Health Department to provide treatment for both the diseases. As many as 1035 persons tested HIV positive and 167 among them were found to have co-infection with the adoption of new methods of health authorities. Blood samples will be collected and sent for HIV tests discreetly so that persons will not face any problems in the society. They will be advised to take treatment if they are tested positive. “Mobile teams will visit remote places to identify co-infection among the patients. It would be easy to get treatment simultaneously if TB patients are tested HIV positive,” said Mrs.Ratna Kumari. “We advised the medical teams not to disclose that HIV tests are also conducted as many people are not keen to attend for medical examination. With this new method, we are hopeful to control AIDS menace in the district,” she added.
