The Andhra Pradesh Medical Council has suspended three doctors for periods varying from three months to five years for resorting to ‘unethical practices.' E. Ravindra Reddy, Chairman, said in a press release on Monday that the Council, at its meeting on November 30, considered 11 cases and awarded punishment to three doctors. The doctors were Pabba Kylas, cardiologist of Karimnagar, B. Jagadish of Medi-Kid Children's Hospital, Ameerpet, and Koutharapu Ravindra of Vijayawada. According to the release, Dr. Kylas has been suspended for two years for misusing the name of the AP Medical Council and printing pamphlets in the name of the registrar with a mala fide intention to defame another medical practitioner. Dr. Jagadish has been suspended for three months for practising as a paediatrician for several years with unrecognised post-graduate diploma i.e. DCH (Vienna) and deleting display of his basic degree — MBBS and trying to project himself as a child's specialist. Dr. Ravindra has been suspended for five years for advertising false claims in media and giving false vaccine in the name of AIDS cure, ‘which is unbecoming of a doctor of modern medicine'.
