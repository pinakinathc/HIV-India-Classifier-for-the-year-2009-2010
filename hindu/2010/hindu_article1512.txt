In a bid to enhance awareness about the dreaded malady AIDS and its causes, a non governmental organization, Kalpana Chawla Memorial Trust, has come out with a painting. In the form of a Red Ribbon, it features a male hand and a female hand, to highlight the importance of both men and women in preventing the spread of AIDS. The painting also cautions the people to ‘Be Aware' and ‘Take Care ‘. Explaining its significance, the Managing Trustee of the Trust, Ramesh, told   that it had been released on Tuesday to mark the observance of World AIDS Day on Wednesday. Pointing out that discipline on the sex front will go a long way in combating the disease, he said that through the painting done by an artist, Varma, it is hoped that the people will acknowledge the benefits of the ‘one man-one woman' way of life. If all adhered to this rule, in course of time an AIDS-free world can be created, he added.
