In an effort to further decentralise the HIV counselling and testing services, the Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have jointly established the Facility Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (FICTCs) in all the 24x7 Primary Health Centres in the district. The facility was introduced in a total of 37 ‘24x7 PHCs in the district recently. As many as 19 ICTCs, including the five Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCTs), were already functioning in the district. The introduction of the FICTCs in the 24x7 PHCs is aimed at expanding the HIV counselling and testing services, which form the crux of the National AIDS Control Programme-III, to the grassroots level and reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS. “The FICTCs will help the people access the integrated services of HIV counselling and testing at the mandal level,” said the District Medical and Health Officer Dr. Champa Naik, who is the district nodal officer in-charge of the AIDS control programme. Speaking to  , he said the new initiative seeks to bring down the maternal and infant mortality rate. “Apart from this, the FICTCs will refer the HIV positive persons to care and treatment services. It is a significant step in HIV prevention, care and treatment,” he remarked. District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit project manager G. Adilingam said that the number of HIV positive cases reduced from 2891 in 2008-09 to 2670 in 2009-10 in the district. The expansion of FICTCs will certainly help further reduce the incidence of HIV in the district, he said. A plan is on the anvil to set up three FICTCs centres in private hospitals one each in Nalgonda, Kodad and Miryalaguda under public-private partnership.
