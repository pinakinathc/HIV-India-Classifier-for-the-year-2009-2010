Swaminathan, Vice Chancellor, Bharathiar University, inaugurated the event in the presence of Baskaran, District Judge, B. Mohamed Ali, District Programme Manager, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, and K. Govindarajulu, Red Ribbon Club Coordinator. The release said the carnival, part of the activities that were launched on July 12, was aimed at creating awareness on HIV/ AIDS among the youth. Individual and group competitions in oratory, drawing, mimicry, music, tattooing and street theatre were held to help the youth showcase their talents. Winners of the competitions would qualify to participate in the final cultural competitions that would be held from August 10 to 12 in Chennai. The release said the carnival would go a long way in creating awareness among the youth, as 73 per cent of those in the 15 â€“ 24 age group had misconceptions about modes of HIV transmission. They constituted 19 per cent of the State's population. Dr. Ali said in Coimbatore, 79 Red Ribbon Clubs with over 8,000 members had been formed to help youth understand the basics of HIV, handle peer pressure, motivate them to donate blood, etc.
