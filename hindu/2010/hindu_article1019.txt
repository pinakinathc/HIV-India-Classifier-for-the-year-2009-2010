During a routine blood check mandatory for cataract surgeries being organised as part of a free eye check camp, the doctors were surprised to encounter the threat of an epidemic-like spread of the deadly Hepatitis-C in border villages of Amritsar district in Punjab. Describing the chance discovery as an eye-opener, a team of doctors and para-medics from the Amritsar-based Dr. Om Parkash Eye Institute was shocked to find as many as 22 patients afflicted by Hepatitis-C and yet another down with HIV+ in Narli village located along the Indo-Pakistan border. The hospital team headed by its director Dr. Rohit Om Parkash and Dr. Maqbool had recently organised a follow-up camp in the village after a team of eye specialists detected 74 cases of cataract that required surgical procedures. The blood tests of 22 of them revealed that they had Hep-C while one man was found to be HIV+. The affected patients range in age from 35 years to 70, including many women. Dr. Rohit has urged the State authorities to take quick measures to prevent it from taking epidemic proportions. “It is a scary situation wherein a majority of these patients remain undetected. The risk factor thus for medical personnel has increased manifold,” he said. At the follow-up camp, the team of doctors explained the gravity of the situation to the village sarpanch Mukhtar Singh and Principal of the government-run senior secondary school Lakha Singh. Mr. Lakha Singh informed the doctors that about 35 per cent of the population in Narli and surrounding villages had taken to drugs while 20 per cent used injections. Being a border village, the drugs were smuggled from across the border and were easily available. He also drew attention to some quacks, the only medical practitioners in the region, who took little or no precaution in administering injections or using other sterilisation techniques.
