Where are our books?: Students staging a dharna in Raichur on Monday . Â   Students from government primary and high schools in the district took out a protest rally and staged a dharna here on Monday in protest against the erratic distribution of textbooks and a hike in fee for student bus passes. At the Deputy Commissioner's office, they staged a dharna demanding that the Government take immediate action to maintain proper supply of textbooks and withdraw the hike in bus pass fee. All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) district unit president Mahesh C., who led the agitation, said even a month after the commencement of classes, the Government had failed to distribute textbooks on time, even though the Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) here had collected money from the students three months ago. The officials concerned have stated that many subjects' textbooks were still under print and would be distributed as soon as they received it from the Government printing unit. On the other hand, the Government has also hiked Rs. 100 on fee for student passes causing hardship to a majority of students from poor- and middle-class families.
