Staff Reporter Rajahmundry: The blood sold by a private blood bank in the city and administered to a constable, an accident victim, is HIV-infected, if the findings of the high-level inquiry committee are any indication. Officials of the Drugs Control Department and the Medical and Health Department are looking into various provisions of relevant Acts that allow action against the Jagruti Blood Bank and punish its owner G. Nageswara Rao. “It is a violation of Schedule Part-12 B of the Drugs Control Act, as the blood supplied by the Jagruti Blood Bank was not properly screened,” says T. Ravi Kumar, Deputy Director, Drugs Control Authority. It may be recalled that a constable working in the III Town police station met with an accident in the wee hours of Monday. He was admitted to the Government Hospital.
