The Rajasthan Mahila Congress has taken up an unusual agenda for the women's wing of any political party. It has asked its workers to identify women in distress, especially those afflicted by HIV, and children orphaned due to their parents' falling victim to AIDS. It is also planning to launch a drive against female feticide which it feels is resulting in a serious imbalance in the male-female ratio in Rajasthan. “We are planning to provide with a set of agenda for the Mahila Congress workers so that issues are identified prior to solutions are found,” said Rajasthan Mahila Congress president Vijaylakshmi Vishnoi. HIV/AIDS is one area where the Mahila Congress workers should get engaged as the ultimate victims of the disease are women and children, added.
