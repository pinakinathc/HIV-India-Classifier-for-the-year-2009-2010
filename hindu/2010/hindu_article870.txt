STYLE FILES Dia Mirza Photo : Shiv Kumar Pushpakar    P art of the model-turned-actor brigade, Dia Mirza has worked with many big banners and is awaiting the release of her new films, some of them long-pending. Excerpts from an interview: It became possible with my conviction and faith. There were also benefits of my Miss Asia-Pacific title in the beginning.   It is my honesty towards my work, which cannot go unrecognised. The length of the role does not matter for me. I always try to give my best. I trust my role and do justice to that. . I enjoyed working with many actors. They are delightful in different ways. Vivek has all his charm. Salman Khan is an amazing actor. With Arjun Rampal I have done most of the movies. He is super cool and Abhishek Bachchan is very nice. I am quietly working on various projects. Some of my movies got stuck, like Sanjay Gupta's  , and Soojit Sircar's  . I am just hoping for their release, so I cannot make any announcement now. In   my character's name is Siya, a free wild child who falls in love with a much older man. It's a beautiful story. I have no clue of its release too. I was lucky to get a chance to work with him. I have grown up watching him on the big screen, so I was very excited about his presence. The first shoot I did with him was a very sensitive and emotional one about the relationship between a father and daughter. He is a breathtaking actor. I indulge in painting, writing, reading, pottery, horse-riding and watching movies. I am also associated with many NGOs. I am a fashion freak and completely up-to-date on global trends. I am always aware of new brands but I am not a brand slave. I like Gauri and Nanika, Shantanu and Nikhil, and Manish Malhotra. SHIVANI JAIN
