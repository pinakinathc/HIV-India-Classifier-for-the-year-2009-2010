Special Correspondent CHENNAI: A new hospital block, the Family Health Centre, was inaugurated at YRG Care within the VHS campus, Taramani, on Thursday. The new block, which adds about 12,000 sq. ft. to YRG Care's existing medical centre, will be a sort of one-stop medical unit for people with HIV requiring treatment. Suniti Solomon, director, YRG Care, said a fully-equipped theatre has also been constructed, in order that people with HIV/AIDS who require surgical interventions are attended to. Surgeons have volunteered to operate at the new medical centre. Recovery rooms have also been constructed; and space allocated for an extensive laboratory, N. Kumaraswamy, chief medical officer at YRG Care, added. Shambu Kalolikar, project director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society, said the contribution of partners such as YRG Care had chipped in to make the Society a role model for the nation. Thanks to the efforts of such agencies, Tamil Nadu is now a decent place for care and treatment. The Centre's target of “Halt and Reverse the Epidemic by 2012” could easily be achieved, he said.
