EXHIBITiON A collection of works by rural women expressing their message through their art Zubaan, the independent feminist publishing house based in New Delhi, is conducting â€˜Poster Women II', an exhibition of art forms by rural women. The works, collected from different parts of the country, include art from the Mithila tradition, contemporary Phad paintings, Jogi work, Sujuni embroidery, Khovar paintings, Gond art, Khatwa and more. Poster Women II was born out of the experiences of Poster Women I, which mapped the women's movement in India through the posters it had produced. In the course of assembling them, Zubaan came across scrolls and tribal art by women (and some men), which used traditional techniques to communicate contemporary messages - including dowry, HIV/ AIDS, child marriage, the tsunami and globalisation. Shweta and Minhazz Majumdar from Zubaan will also be there, to share stories and histories of the people they came across during their journey. The show will be on at the Madras Terrace House till February 28. For details, call 98188 82553.
