Forlorn: Inmates of an old age home in Adilabad.   | Photo Credit:  S. Harpal Singh ADILABAD: Living until ripe age is no longer considered a boon even among the middle-class rural societies in the country. It is now being seen as a curse in places like Adilabad, given the growing incidence of the elderly being abandoned by their children. The three homes for aged being run in Adilabad district, including the one opened last month at Sai Lingi village in Talamadugu village, provide a clue to the emerging problem at hand. “I put the number at five old persons per village,” observes R. Surender, director of the SAIDS NGO that runs the old age home at Mahalaxmiwada with 25 inmates to look after. Most of the inmates, all hailing from low and middle-class families, say they were forced to take shelter in the SAIDS run home for the aged because their children abandoned them. Inmates like the frail Shankarwar Vittal, the lame Lingalolla Posani and the bent-with-age Dattaram Goud have similar tales of woe to narrate. “I was beaten up before being thrown out.” “My sons considered me a burden soon after I stopped earning owing to ill health.” “No one has come to visit me at this home.” The 25 inmates of the SAIDS run old age home consider themselves to be fortunate as they are looked after and cared for well. Curiously, some of the inmates recalled good old days when taking care of geriatrics was considered a holy task. If an old person had no family to fend for him, the community at large looked after him. One of the major reasons for the younger generation exhibiting intolerance towards their own elderly is perhaps the breaking up of the joint family system. The pressures of earning in the low and middle class families has added to it.
