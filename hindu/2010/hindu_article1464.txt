A two-day sports and cultural event for children living with HIV, “Champion in Me 2010”, concluded here on Sunday with more than 300 children displaying their enthusiasm and talent in a variety of sports and recreational activities. Organised by Bangalore Schools Sports Foundation in association with Sneha Care Home and Shining Star School at Snehadaan on Sarjapur Road, children from various support and care centres in the State participated in athletics, football and throw-ball. The programme was inaugurated by Archbishop of Bangalore Bernard Moras. Former international hockey player Ashish Ballal and former international athlete Reeth Abraham were present. The sports and cultural meet was organised to help children living with HIV show their hidden talents. According to director of Sneha Care Home Father Mathew, the programme was a well-designed sports-based initiative aimed at providing a holistic approach to physical and mental well-being of children living with HIV. “Such fun-filled competitive events will break down barriers, build self-esteem and confidence, besides bringing about a healthy behaviour among the participants. It also ensures that children living with HIV are not discriminated against,” an organiser said.
