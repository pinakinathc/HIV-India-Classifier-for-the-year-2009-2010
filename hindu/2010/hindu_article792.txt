They were protesting against the alleged non-availability of school text books for the Oriya medium schools in the State. They also handed over a memorandum at the office demanding the State government to take immediate measures so that text books could be available for students at the earliest. It may be noted that although students promoted to new classes begun their new session from April, most schoolstudents in the State are yet to get their new text books due to their non-availability in the market, alleged DSO activist Somnath Behera. As per the government policy, textbooks are to be supplied by Orissa Textbooks Press which are distributed to the schools through block resource centres of Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan. These books are also sold in the market. But sufficient number of books has not reached the students yet. Due to non-receipt of books and dearth of teachers, education in schools has suffered drastically alleged the agitating students. They alleged that in rural areas students are still waiting for proper amount of stock of text books to arrive.
