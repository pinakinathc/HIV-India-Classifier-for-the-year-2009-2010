A woman inmate of the Destitute Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) at Jyothinagar here died on Tuesday due to ill-health. District Officer (Backward Classes and Minorities) Mayadevi Galagali said the inmate, Sumalatha, who was from Andhra Pradesh, was apparently HIV-affected. The woman was aged about 40 and was brought to the centre a year ago by her husband. Minister in-charge of Mysore district S. Suresh Kumar, during his recent visit to the centre in the wake of the deaths at the beggars' home in Bangalore, had asked the authorities to provide proper medical treatment to the inmate. She was found sleeping on a mat without care when the Minister visited the centre. Sumalatha, however, died within 48 hours of the Minister's direction. Officials said she was under treatment at K.R. Hospital. It is learnt that officials of the Department of Social Welfare here have been asked to screen all inmates and provide proper medical aid to them. Meanwhile, the authorities are preparing a list of inmates who are from other States and will alert their family members to take them home. Many inmates are said to be from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
