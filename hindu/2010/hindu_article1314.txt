In a series of interviews to appear in a book published this week, Pope Benedict said that while the use of condoms should not be seen as a “moral solution”, he stepped back from the Vatican's blanket ban on all forms of contraception. “In certain cases, where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection, it can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another, more humane sexuality,” said the head of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics. Pope Benedict sparked an international outcry in March 2009 on a visit to AIDS-ravaged Africa when he told reporters that the distribution of condoms could even aggravate the pandemic. To illustrate his apparent shift in position, Pope Benedict offered the example of a male prostitute using a condom. “There may be justified individual cases, for example when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be ... a first bit of responsibility, to re-develop the understanding that not everything is permitted and that one may not do everything one wishes,” Pope Benedict was quoted as saying in the new book. “But it is not the proper way to deal with the horror of HIV infection”. While some campaigners said that the Pope's comments did not go anywhere near far enough, there was a general consensus that they would help in the fight against AIDS. The head of the U.N. agency leading the international campaign against AIDS said Pope Benedict's comments were a “significant and positive step forward”. “This move recognises that responsible sexual behaviour and the use of condoms have important roles in HIV prevention,” UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe said in a statement. — AFP
