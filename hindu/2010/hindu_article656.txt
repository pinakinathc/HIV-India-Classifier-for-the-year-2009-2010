In a first for India, the final report of Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission has recommended inclusion of transgender community under in the OBC list under the name “Mangalamukhi” and inclusion of children of sex workers and HIV positive people under the name “Sankula”. The report, first submitted to the Governor and later to the Chief Minister by the commission's outgoing chairperson C.S. Dwarakanath, has recommended a separate ministry for backward classes. The other major recommendations include raising creamy layer ceiling from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 4.5 lakh and another on setting up a separate commission for nomadic communities. Both these recommendations were submitted to the Government one-and-a-half years ago, but not implemented. The commission has also recommended providing permanent posting to temporary teachers of Morarji Desai residential schools, reservation for backward classes in the cooperative sector, educational fee concession to Category I of Backward Classes, improving nutrient value of food given in backward class hostels and special packages to nomadic tribes. In one of the recommendations likely to irk the ruling BJP Government, the Backward Classes Commission has opposed the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter And Preservation Of Cattle Bill, 2010, on the ground that it goes against the interests of backward classes. Mr. Dwarakananth said that the Bill goes against the food culture of some communities who consume beef and also against interest of other communities in the list who do cattle-raring for a living.
