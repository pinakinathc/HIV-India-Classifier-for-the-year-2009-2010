Protesting against the continuous shortage of HIV/AIDS testing kits and disparity in salary, more than 30 HIV/AIDS counsellors of Bangalore Urban division on Thursday refused to submit the monthly reports of their jurisdictional Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) to the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). The counsellors made it clear to officials from KSAPS and District AIDS Control Society that they would not submit the reports until they were assured of a regular supply of kits. The 565 testing centres in the State need at least 4,000 kits a month. Following the shortage, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) had written to all AIDS Control Societies to use the available kits judiciously. Another issue bothering the counsellors is the disparity in salary of counsellors across the State. The salary of all counsellors and staff of ICTCs across the State, except for nine districts, has been fixed at Rs. 10,000.
