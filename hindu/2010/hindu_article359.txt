Staff Reporter HYDERABAD: Every year, the world observes Haemophilia Day on April 17. This time around, the Haemophilia Society, Hyderabad Chapter, has asked the government to subsidise the costly treatment. Nearly 10,000 people in the State suffer from the genetic disorder and most cannot afford the treatment, which runs into lakhs. For them, the Rs. 50,000 provided by the Rajiv Arogyasri scheme is a pittance. The World Federation of Haemophilia kicked off campaigns to inform more people about bleeding disorders, and push for a greater effort to manage them better. “Think of the human gene as a computer code,” says Dr. Srinivas Chakravarty, an Oncologist at Apollo Hospitals. “If the code is wrong, the programme won't work as well as it should.” Similarly, if the gene is faulty, its products will fall short. The human gene produces two separate proteins that clot blood after an injury - Factor VIII and Factor IX. If the gene in question goes wrong, and no one really knows why they do, the two proteins won't work as well as they should. And this causes haemophilia. Threat to life In its mildest form, haemophilia causes patients to bruise easy or bleed for a long time. When at its worst, it's a threat to their lives. “If patients bleed in the joints, they are robbed of flexible movement,” says Dr. Chakravarty. “If they bleed in the brain, they can go into a coma or be paralysed.” The smallest of injuries can lead to these ‘spontaneous haemorrhages'. Costly affair Treatment takes the form of injecting healthy proteins into the patient's body. It costs anywhere between Rs. 2 to 4 lakh. “This is only in severe cases but they are perennially in need of it,” explains Dr. Chakravarty. The chances of them contracting HIV or Hepatitis are, therefore, higher than usual. Gene therapy is seen as a possible cure albeit an expensive one.
