Rise in HIV positive cases in Tirupur district is causing concern among the medical fraternity here. “An average of 30 people are testing positive for HIV every month at the 22 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) run by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society and the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre at the District Headquarters Hospital in the district,” Dr. N. Jegadeesan, medical officer at the ART centre in District Headquarters Hospital, told  . There could be more persons - not confirmed of having contracted the disease because they had not undergone tests, Dr. Jegadeesan said. 808 HIV cases At present, 808 HIV positive persons have registered with the ART centre which was opened on April 1 this year. Many other HIV positive cases from the district were being treated at the ART centre in Coimbatore, health department sources said. Treatment for 521 Of the 808 people registered with the ART here, 521 were undergoing treatment. The remaining were still in the pre-ART stage (those who have CD4 counts of more than 250). According to statistics, 403 of 808 were men, 363 women and 21 each were boys and girls, the sources said. Dr. Jegadeesan said majority of those who were tested positive were between 20 and 30 years. Unprotected sex was said to be the reason for the rising incidence of HIV in the district. Difficulties in identifying infected migrant workers compounded the problem.
