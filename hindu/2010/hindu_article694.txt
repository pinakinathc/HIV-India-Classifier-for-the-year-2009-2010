Gandhiselvan, Union Minister of State for Health. Speaking at the inauguration of ‘Youth Carnival 2010' here on Monday, he said 22.7 lakh people in the country were living with AIDS. It was a serious challenge as a good number of them were youth. Youth force was an asset to the country and they could not be allowed to be bogged down by AIDS. Governments were responsible for guiding the youth and it was for this purpose that the Union Government had sanctioned Rs. 7,009 crore under the National AIDS Control Organisation for 2007-12. Of that the Government had spent Rs. 3,000 crore and that included awareness creation. The youth carnival was a part of the efforts to create awareness. Referring to Tamil Nadu, Mr. Gandhiselvan said it was in the forefront in battling AIDS. The total number of youth in the State was 1.11 crore. Of those, 2.46 per cent men and 3.11 per cent women in the 15-24 age group were HIV positive. To meet their requirements, the State Government had set up 36 Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres.Pongalur N. Palanisamy, Minister for Rural Industries and Animal Husbandry, said the purpose of organising the event was not only to help the youth showcase their sporting talents but also gain awareness on HIV/AIDS. Collector P. Umanath, Mayor R. Venkatachalam and Deputy Director, Health Services, P. Senthil Kumar also participated.
