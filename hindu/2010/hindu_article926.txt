The All India Democratic Students' Organisation will organise a students' march to Jantar Mantar on August 27 to protest against the “larger design of the government” to transform higher education into a field of lucrative investment by commercialisation and privatisation. “The government says it is aiming for expansion, education and excellence in the field of education. In fact it is only trying to expand the area for investment,” AIDSO general secretary Sourav Mukherjee said at a press conference here on Tuesday. AIDSO voiced its opposition to the Foreign Universities Bill alleging that it would result in the degeneration of the university system with education being treated as a commodity. The Educational Tribunals Bill was opposed on the grounds that it would not be able to address the problems of all educational institutions in the country as envisaged. The proposal to constitute a National Commission for Higher Education and Research too came under criticism. It was alleged that the commission had been conceptualised as a centralised body which would result in the undemocratic administration of education.
