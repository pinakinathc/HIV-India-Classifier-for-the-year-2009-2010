The A.P. State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) has created a record by testing about 85,000 persons staying in high risk areas under ‘Subham' programme in a period of one year. Of them, 3,500 tested positive and steps have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease. After the success of ‘Subham' project in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and other States are planning to take up the programme, said the APSACS Joint Director P. L. Jaya Chandra Reddy at a seminar on ‘Social Science Research', organised by the Department of Social Work, Vikrama Simhapuri University (VSU). Registrar V. Narayana Reddy presided over the meeting. Speaking to   later, the APSACS Joint Director said all the 85,000 people residing in high risk areas were tested three times — from July 2009 to July 2010. The APSACS was analysing the reasons for cause of the disease and preventing its spread. Stating that sex workers, homosexuals, intravenous drug-users, business centres and villages close to highways and unhygienic sex were some of the reasons for the spread of HIV, Dr. Jaya Chandra Reddy said that 210 towns were mapped for identifying high risk group areas in the State. The East Godavari district had the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients among pregnant women in State with 1.5 per cent (15 persons) out of every 1,000 tested persons. In A.P. the percentage of AIDS patients had come down from 2.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent in the last five years due to increased awareness levels.
