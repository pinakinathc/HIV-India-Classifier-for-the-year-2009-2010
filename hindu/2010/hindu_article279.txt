Hariharan has stressed the need for utilising the ongoing awareness campaign to know more about HIV/AIDS in order to take preventive steps. Inaugurating the exhibition of Red Ribbon Express, which carries loads of information about HIV/AIDS, at Rameswaram Railway Station on Saturday, he said that it was heartening to note that various Central and State government agencies had been working towards creating awareness of AIDS. Some of the campaign themes were innovative. They had reached the targeted people. It was necessary that people should take interest to know facts about HIV/AIDS. He said inspite of vigorous campaign there were reports that people affected with AIDS had been discriminated. There was nothing wrong in touching, speaking and serving food to them. The stigma had to be eradicated. People should develop self discipline to fight AIDS. The Red Ribbon Express would be stationed at Rameswaram on Sunday also. Mr. Hariharan said as many as 1,232 persons were infected with HIV/AIDS in Ramanathapuram district. Around 430 patients were getting treatment in ART centres. A.
