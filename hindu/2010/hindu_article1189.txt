Did you know that the silent stroke is responsible for more deaths every year than those attributed to AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria put together? The three diseases might have set the benchmark for successful public health advocacy, hogging the global media glare, but with a ‘single stroke', the stroke can make them appear little. At the ‘World Stroke Day' celebrations observed at SVIMS hospital here on Friday, Member of Parliament Chinta Mohan, who is himself a medical practitioner, gave a clarion call to keep the disease at bay. He threw light on the ‘one in six' formula, which could help curtail the disease. TTD's Joint Executive Officer N.Yuvaraj hoped the awareness programme would help his employees understand the professional risk. “Knowing personal risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes and high blood cholesterol, staying physically fit, keeping a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding smoking are the essential factors”, SVIMS Director B. Vengamma said. She further added that: “Learning to recognizing the warning signs of a stroke and how to take action is equally important”. K. Rami Reddy, a retired IAS official lighted the lamp, while Dr. Madhavi, principal of SVIMS College of Physiotherapy welcomed.
