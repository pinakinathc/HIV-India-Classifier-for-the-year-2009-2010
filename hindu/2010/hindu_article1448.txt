Ganjam district was adjudged one of the five best districts in the country which could utilise the sojourn of ‘Red Ribbon Express' to the optimum level. Ganjam district Collector V.K. Pandian will be receiving citation and award for it from the Union Health Minister in New Delhi on Wednesday. Mr. Pandian said it was an award for the people of the district who have decided to use knowledge to check the menace of HIV infection and AIDS. It may be noted that Ganjam happens to be the most HIV infection-prone district in Orissa. As per the rate of prevalence of HIV infection, Ganjam district stands in the 14 {+t} {+h} position in the country. The Red Ribbon Express (RRE), an initiative of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and Indian Railways during its second phase of the journey across the country reached Berhampur on May 6 evening. It remained open for the public at Berhampur railway station for two days on May 7 and 8. During these two days, more than 31,800 persons visited the Red Ribbon Express. Around 320 persons had got themselves tested at the HIV testing facility inside the train. A large chunk of them were youths. Regional coordinator of Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS) Lokanath Mishra said through the coordinated efforts of health officials, administration, OSACS, NGOs involved in AIDS, awareness work and rehabilitation of HIV positive persons the message of Red Ribbon Express could be reached out to at least 2800 villages of Ganjam district. ‘Gaon Kalyan Samities (GKS)' in these villages were utilised for the purpose. Each GKS sent a team of five members to the Red Ribbon Express. The team included the local anganwadi worker, Asha volunteer and elected ward member, mostly women. After returning, they took up awareness measures in their own village especially among the women who are most prone to HIV infection due to their ignorance and illiteracy.
