The trial was conducted at the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC), Chennai and at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune. There were totally 32 volunteers recruited for the trial, and each centre had 16 volunteers. The 16 volunteers were split into two groups â€” Group A and Group B. In the case of Group A, six volunteers received the ADVAX-MVA prime boost vaccine and two received the placebo. And in the case of Group B, six received the MVA-MVA prime boost vaccine and two received the placebo. The prime-boost regimen and the number of volunteers who received the vaccine/placebo were the same for both TRC and NARI. Volunteers in Group A received the prime (ADVAX) on the date of recruitment (0 month) and month 1. They received the boost (MVA) on month 3 and month 6. Volunteers in Group B received only one dose of the prime (MVA) on the date of recruitment (0 month). They received the boost (MVA) on month 1 and month 6.
