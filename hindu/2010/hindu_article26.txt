Special Correspondent VELLORE: “One need not be a doctor to provide good coverage to health issues in the media. All you need is the art of telling a story,” according to Norman Swan, Australian journalist. He was participating in a discussion on ‘Evidence-Informed Public Health’ held as part of the 8th Winter Symposium on Evidence for Public Health organised by Christian Medical College here on Tuesday. Dwelling on issues concerning journalism, public relations and media coverage of health-related matters after eliciting from a gathering of journalists, researchers, public relations personnel, doctors and medical students the points they wanted him to discuss, Dr. Swan, who is a paediatrician-turned journalist, said that some of the best health journalists in Australia are not medical people. Health journalists were trained in Australia, he said. Tracing the “terrible” reporting about Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) during the initial days of the reporting of AIDS cases more than two decades ago, Dr. Swan said that Australian newspapers used to have headlines such as “Mosquitoes spread AIDS.” Australia was quick to set right the mistakes by embarking on a programme of creating awareness of the causes of HIV with focus on teaching commercial sex workers, both men and women, and on the need to use condoms. Population-based studies made in Australia on what interested newspaper editors and broadcast producers and what interested the public showed that media representatives were more interested in economics and politics, which was exactly opposite to the public. Broadcast producers who were interested in better ratings for their programmes were not interested in health journalism, Dr. Swan said.
