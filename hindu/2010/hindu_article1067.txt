Sowmish    Blood donation camps and cultural programmes, marked the National Voluntary Blood Donation Day on October 1. Kerala University of Health and Allied Sciences Vice-Chancellor K. Mohandas inaugurated various programmes organised by the Indian Medical Association Blood Bank, Thrissur, in connection with the day. V. K. Gopinath, director of IMA blood bank, said that the main objective of celebrating the Blood Donation Day was to encourage youngsters to donate blood. The World Health Organisation advocates its member States to encourage only safest blood donors, who are voluntary, non-remunerated donors from low-risk populations, to ensure safety and quality of blood transfusion. According to WHO, replacement and paid donors, who are associated with higher prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infections, including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, still provide more than 50 per cent of the blood collected in developing countries. Awareness was created among people to come forward voluntarily to donate blood so that sufficient supplies were maintained in the blood banks to meet emergencies or scheduled needs. The message of this year's National Voluntary Blood Donation Day was ‘Celebrate the Gift of Blood' and ‘New Blood for the World'. About 100 students from various colleges donated blood. Poster making and painting competitions were held for students in connection with the observation. Basic life-saving training for policemen, counselling for suicide prevention, disaster management, immunization drive are the other major services of the IMA.
