Members of the district units of the All-India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO), the All-India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) and the All-India Mahila Samskritika Sanghatane (AIMSS) took out a procession and staged a dharna here on Wednesday, to demand that the North-East Karnataka Road Travel Corporation (NEKRTC) refund additional charges collected from the students while issuing bus passes. They asked that the students be allowed to make use of the bus passes on Sundays and on holidays. The activists, including students from schools and colleges, went in a procession from Ambedkar Circle here and reached the office of the Divisional Controller of the Raichur division of NEKRTC. They submitted a memorandum to the him, urging the authorities concerned to agree to their demands. G. Pramod Kumar, secretary of the district unit of AIDSO, said NEKRTC had recently withdrawn the hike on bus passes when students had agitated against it. But, it had failed to refund the additional amount to the students, he said. Besides, the students had faced difficulties in using bus passes on Sundays and holidays. The department had not extended such facility for students even as it collected the necessary charges for the entire academic period, Mr. Kumar said.
