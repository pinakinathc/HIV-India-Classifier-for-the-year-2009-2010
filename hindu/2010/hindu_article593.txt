Leaders of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the Telugu Nadu Students Federation (TNSF), the Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU) and the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) have given a call for a State bandh on June 29 in protest against what they described as “callous indifference” of the State government towards resolving various issues, especially the non-release of Rs. 2,083-crore arrears under fee reimbursement and scholarships. State-level leaders and office-bearers of these student organisations met here on Friday and held discussions to chart out their future course of action to exert pressure on the government to resolve students' problems. Criticising the government for the “inordinate delay” in releasing scholarships, the leaders of these organisations demanded that all the arrears from 2008 on account of fee reimbursement as well as scholarships be released immediately. The leaders who participated in the meeting included SFI State secretary K. Chandra Mohan, district secretary Krishna, PDSU State president Avula Ashok and TNSF State secretary Sriram. Addressing a press conference later, Mr. Chandra Mohan said that the student unions were forced to call for a State bandh following lack of response from the government to their repeated appeals for resolving students' issues.
