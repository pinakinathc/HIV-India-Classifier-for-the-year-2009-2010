As many as 500 ESI nurses will be trained under Project Sankalp to upgrade healthcare and nursing facilities for those covered under the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) scheme in Karnataka. The project, a joint initiative of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust (HLFPPT) and Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), was started in August 2008 in response to the alarming trend of HIV among the ESI-covered population. As many as 500 nurses operating at various ESI hospitals and dispensaries in Karnataka will be trained on family planning methods and legal issues, which would help them serve the women, children and people living with HIV in an effective manner. The training is aimed at refreshing the technical skills of nurses and sensitising the healthcare providers on the needs of those living with HIV. Inaugurating the training session at the Indiranagar ESI Hospital on Thursday, ESIC State Medical Director Kavi Shetty said combined efforts by doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and NGOs would help in bringing down the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the State.
