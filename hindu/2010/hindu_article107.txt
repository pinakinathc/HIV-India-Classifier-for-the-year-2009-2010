J.S. Ifthekhar Hyderabad: It's a crisis-ridden hospital. Always in the news for the wrong reasons. But amid all the tension-packed drama that unfolds here everyday, Niloufer Hospital is turning a new leaf. It is shortly going to have the world's largest paediatric intensive care unit. A 450-bedded block named after Rajiv Gandhi is coming up fast right at the entrance of the hospital. The Rs. 27-crore five-storeyed block will have sophisticated equipment to deal with all critical cases. Again for the first time, Niloufer Hospital will have a centre of excellence to treat paediatric HIV/AIDS cases. A new ART building which is almost ready will start functioning from next month. The National Aids Control Organisation has sanctioned Rs. 63 lakh for this facility. It will be a nodal centre for treatment of HIV/AIDS among children in the entire State. “We will carry out investigations, counselling besides training and research here”, said P. Sudershan Reddy, superintendent, Niloufer Hospital. The hospital is also going in for a corporate style Arogyasri office. A 20-bedded Arogyasri ward has recently started functioning in Unit I and it is proposed to set up similar wards in other six units. Incidentally, Niloufer's performance has come in for appreciation in implementation of the Arogyasri scheme among all teaching hospitals. Government has termed as ‘satisfactory' the performance of Niloufer and King George Hospital, Vishakapatnam. Resource crunch notwithstanding, hospital authorities have recently set up a six bed level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a 12 bed advanced paediatric intensive care unit. All critically ill children are admitted here. Each bed here is attached with a multi-channel monitor.
