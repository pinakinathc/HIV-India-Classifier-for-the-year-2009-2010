Special Correspondent KURNOOL: The incidence of respiratory diseases, especially asthma, has gone up by 50 per cent due to environmental pollution, said G. Kullayappa, a retired chest physician. Talking to reporters in connection with the World Asthma Day on Tuesday, he said air pollution was on the rise and pointed out that passive smoking also caused asthma because of exposure of children and women to smoke in the house and public places. According to Dr. Kullayappa, around 10 to 15 per cent of the world population was affected by asthma. The world accounted for 30 crore asthma patients of which 4 crore were from India alone. The disease caused two lakh deaths every year. Asthma treatment, he said, is more expensive than the treatment of TB and HIV. Dr. Kullayappa said that exposure to dust, perfumes, talcum powder, emotional problems, stress and chemical contamination of food items also contributed to asthma. He added that the patients could effectively protect themselves from the disease by avoiding allergy causing food stuffs and conditions like chill weather, smoke and dust. He went on to say that the latest medications available in the market helped the patients to live a normal life. More than medicines the patients required counselling, making them aware of the right use of inhalers.
