Writer Sunanda Kadame has said education at present was getting restricted to the four walls of the classroom and collecting statistics and reproducing the same in the examination. Inaugurating the second district-level conference of the All-India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) here, she said there was a need for the kind of education that increased hunger for knowledge and helped one imbibe humanitarian values. Ms. Kadame said that in the past, agitations and movements brought freshness into society. “There is a wide gap between the exploited class and those with the resources. Today, only those with money can afford quality education. Keeping all this in mind, there is need for a concerted fight to build a society that ensures equal opportunities for all,” she said. Dharwad district secretary of the Socialist Unity Centre of India Ramanjanappa Aldalli said there was conflict in every field. Commercialisation of education, privatisation of the health sector, soaring prices and unemployment had made lives miserable. “Governments have become slaves to the capitalists. At a time when basic facilities such as health and education are not available to the common people, capitalists are allowed to loot the people,” he said. State secretary of AIDSO Pramod said it was alarming that the exorbitant fees charged by institutions was forcing many students to cut short their education. Subsequently, at the delegates' convention, various resolutions were adopted with regard to the next course of action on various problems. A new district committee was also constituted on the occasion. Gangadhar Badiger and Nagaraj Talageri were selected president and vice-president of the committee. Sharana Basava and Geeta Hegde were selected secretary and associate secretary, respectively. Students also took out a procession.
