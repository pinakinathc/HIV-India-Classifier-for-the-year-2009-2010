A 35-year-old man's mortal remains became the 1000 {+t} {+h} unclaimed body that was given a farewell by Thozhar Trust, a voluntary organisation that buries or cremates unclaimed bodies lying at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. “We began with four bodies on March 28, 2004,” Managing Trustee of the organisation P. Shanthakumar said. “We have buried or cremated 1,000 bodies in six years. This points at the rising detachment within families. At the funeral procession today [Thursday], we stressed familial bond. Why should someone die unwanted on the roads ?” he said. The 1000 {+t} {+h} body was that of a person who died on September 14 because of a disease. No one had claimed it. “We have taken up the last rites of accident victims, destitute men and women who died on roads or at other public places because of illness, abandoned children and AIDS and leprosy patients,” he said. Members of the Trust, 40 lawyers, autorickshaw drivers, men and women members of the public, Hindu and Muslim organisations and students of Sri Krishna Arts and Science College, Jayendra Saraswati College of Arts and Science, Government Arts College and Bishop Ambrose College took part in a campaign for body and eye donation that was made part of the procession, Mr. Shanthakumar said. Deputy Mayor N. Karthik and CMCH Medical Superintendent A. Mathivanan were present when the procession began at the hospital. Mr. Shanthakumar said the city police enabled a smooth procession from the hospital to the Coimbatore Corporation's burial ground at Puliakulam. All sections of society understood and supported the Trust's initiative. On its part, the Trust called upon families not to dump its suffering members and leave them on roads without care.
