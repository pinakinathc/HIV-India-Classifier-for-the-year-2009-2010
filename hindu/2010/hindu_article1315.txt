Fun all the way Students of Footloose performing at their annual day celebrations PHOTO: M: PERIASAMY    D ance school Footloose stepped in to its 19th year in style. There were spotlights, glitter, fun and of course, foot-tapping dance performances. Edwin Eddy's students charged up the dance floor with their best moves. The programme kicked off with a contemporary style of dance to an A.R. Rahman chartbuster. Dressed in black and gold with well-designed props, the youngsters were greeted by rapturous applause. There were well-choreographed hip-hop and folk performances too. The ‘Halloween dance,' the first performance by the younger lot of Footloose stood out. Dressed in superhero suits, the tiny tots easily won the audience over. The kids were at their best with the ‘Kite dance,' a seamlessly choreographed dance for a Tamil melody. Footloose had also invited groups from Chennai to take part in the celebrations. Rinson, Pranav, Advita and Aparna of Vijay TV fame danced to a repertoire of fast-paced numbers – it was amazing to see them glide across the stage with such professional expertise. Huge robots then entered the hall. Music from ‘Enthiran' blared out of the speakers as they mounted the stage to shake a leg with some more dancers in robot outfits. A ‘carnival dance,' complete with feather headdresses, fluffy skirts and feather fantails captured the spirit and gaiety of a carnival. The detailing put into the outfits took the performance up a notch. Three year old Kanishka and Hariharan, the youngest of all the performers that evening looked cute as they danced to another favourite from ‘Enthiran'. Some of Edwin's best dancers were honoured on stage. The school also organised a ‘Social Cause Expo' earlier in the day for spreading awareness on HIV/AIDS, global warming, child labour, eye donation, water resources management etc. AKILA KANNADASAN
