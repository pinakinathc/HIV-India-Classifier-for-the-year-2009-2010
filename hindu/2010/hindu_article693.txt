Over 20 children suffering from thalassaemia have tested positive for HIV and Hepatitis C allegedly after transfusion of infected blood at a government hospital here, two years after a similar incident had prompted an inquiry by the Rajasthan government. Terming it a case of negligence, Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the State government was responsible for the incident. While three children were found infected with HIV in May after they were tested at the S.N. Medical College, 17 more tested positive for the Hepatitis C virus, the Marwar Thalassaemia Society claimed. Two more children were infected with Hepatitis B. Hospital officials said that a three-member committee had been formed by the hospital to enquire into the matter. “It is a case of negligence. It is the responsibility of the State government to take proper precautions,” Mr. Azad said in Srinagar. At least five children were infected with HIV and 29 with Hepatitis at the same hospital in December 2008 following transfusion of infected blood after which the State government had constituted a committee headed by the Director of State AIDS Control Society R.N.D. Purohit, who had suggested the need for reforms in blood donation process. Secretary of Thalassaemia Society Vipin Gupta claimed that no action was taken on the report. “Had the step been taken on the recommendation of that committee, we would not have had these new HIV infections,” he said. However, the principal of S.N. Medical College, R.K. Aseri, said that a proposal for introducing the advanced Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) technique has already been sent to the State government. — PTI
