Bringing into play key factors like ‘dissemination' of knowledge and ‘mainstreaming' of the people living with HIV/AIDS, a workshop organised by the HLFPPT (Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust) brought on a common platform representatives of 12 government departments from six districts in the region on Monday. The conference hall of hotel Manorama became a common ground for discussing threadbare issues related to prevention and care of the HIV-affected population, advocacy, coordination and treatment. Officials drawn from various government wings like police, labour, DRDA and Women and Child Welfare representing the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore, Khammam and West Godavari, were part of the workshop, hosted with the support of Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). It also served as a platform to sensitise chief stakeholders on the roles of the NACO and DAPCU (District AIDS Prevention and Control Units) “The whole idea is to disseminate knowledge on issues related to AIDS to the various government departments and help them explore means to help ‘streamline' People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs),” said D. Srinivas Rao, State manager of HLFPPT. The HLFPPT efforts to enable government officials to realise the importance and implications of the collective drive against the monster virus seemingly made an impact with the departments coming up with a series of proposals that were aimed at wiping out discrimination against the virus-hit. Representatives of various government wings expressed their willingness to do their bit in strengthening the hands of those involved in the battle against the virus. The multi-sectoral approach is aimed at providing the much-needed impetus to the anti-AIDS drive. Favourable response from the respective departments to proposals of free bus pass to PLHAs to visit ART centres, priority to the HIV-hit in job melas, supply of nutritious food and extension of Antyodaya Anna Yojana to the PLHAs and preference in disbursement of loans gave a ray of hope that the virus-afflicted would get the better of the odds in the days to come.
