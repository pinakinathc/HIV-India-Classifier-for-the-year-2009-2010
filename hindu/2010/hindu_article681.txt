The passion for theatre and memories of John Abraham were more appealing to the crowd at the Town Hall on Friday evening than the World Cup quarterfinal match between Brazil and Denmark. So they stayed back till the last event of the day-long commemoration to the legendary filmmaker, organised by Rebel Youth Dreams, a collective of young activists. Inaugurating the movement, singer Umbayi, who was a long-time friend of John Abraham, said that the latter always fought against injustice. He is being missed in the modern age where values have been lost in arts – be it films or music, Umbayi said. The inaugural session, over which Mayor Mercy Williams presided, was followed by the screening of documentaries and short films – starting with the one on John Abraham himself. The film   was made by renowned documentary filmmaker C. Saratchandran, who passed away recently in an accident. Other films screened on Friday were documentaries   (The Hunted) made by Shaji Pattanam on the lives of Adivasis in Muthanga and   on the life of a Muslim woman who died of AIDS; short fictions like   and  ; animation films like   and   children's film   directed by State-award winner M.G. Sasi. The afternoon session was marked out for commemoration of T.A. Indukumar, theatre activist, who was killed in a motor accident in 1992. In his speech, theatre person A.R. Ratheesan said that Indukumar represented the vitality and vigour of theatre movement in the Eighties. The short-play titled  , directed by Babu Aluva, was staged after this. While the films were being screened and plays were being staged, a group of young artists were fully focussed on capturing the essence of the filmmaker and theatre person who explored unseen realms of creativity to their canvases. The day ended in a colourful manner with the staging of the play   (a bride twice) by students of the Department of Theatre, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady.
