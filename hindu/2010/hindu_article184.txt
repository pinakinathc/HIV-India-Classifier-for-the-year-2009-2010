Staff Correspondent Bijapur: Members of the Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) and the All-India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO) took out a rally here on Monday to protest against the poor condition of roads in the city. The protesters gathered in front of the Sri Siddeshwar temple and took out a procession that ended at the Deputy Commissioner’s office premises. They also raised slogans against the district administration and the elected representatives for their failure to address the problem. Addressing the agitators, SUCI district secretary Bhagwan Reddy alleged that even after four months of the floods, the authorities had failed to repair the roads in the city. As traffic on the main roads had been diverted, heavy vehicles were finding it difficult to pass through interior roads. The main road in front of the bus terminus had also been dug up to facilitate cleaning of underground drainage pipes, but the work had been stopped owing to shortage of funds. When asked about the progress on road-repair work, officials said that a Rs. 25-crore action plan had been prepared to improve the drainage system and that the roads would be re-laid after that. The roads at Basaveshwar Circle and at Ambedkar Circle were also damaged during the floods, Mr. Reddy said and alleged that no steps had been taken to re-lay them. This clearly indicated lack of interest on the part of officials. The protesters submitted a memorandum in this regard to Deputy Commissioner R. Shantraju.
