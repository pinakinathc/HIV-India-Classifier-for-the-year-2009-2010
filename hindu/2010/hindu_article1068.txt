The District AIDS Prevention and Control Committee will organise awareness programmes and voluntary blood donation camps in various places involving various communities on October 1 – the National Blood Donation Day. The Additional District Medical and Health Officer R. Rajendra Prasad has said that nothing was comparable to human blood despite rapid technological development in the medical care arena as manufacturing of blood was not possible even today. Awareness is created among people to come forward voluntarily to donate blood so that sufficient supplies were maintained in the blood banks to meet emergencies or scheduled needs. “By donating blood we can give a new lease of life to people,” he added. Voluntary organisations like www.friends2support.org maintain a registry of voluntary blood donors of all blood groups so that they could be contacted 24X7 in any part of India. Focus was currently on formation of Voluntary Blood Donors' Clubs, who could in turn make their contact details public to help people have an access to the database get voluntary donations as and when needed. As per national and World Health Organisation's policy, young people should be tapped to help infuse young blood into the system so that chances of infected blood reduce. According to WHO norms, every youth should be able to donate at least 40 times between 18 and 35 years. The Voluntary Blood Donation Day celebrations would be inaugurated on the V.S. Krishna Government College premises at 10 a.m. with a donation camp.
