Staff Reporter VIJAYAWADA: The Forum for Legal, Ambulance, Social and Health Services (FLASH), a service organisation floated by a group of advocates, launched an awareness campaign on corruption in the city on Tuesday. The organisation published pamphlets with details of addresses and telephone numbers of authorities concerned, such as deputy superintendent of police of the Anti-Corruption Bureau, superintendent of police of the CBI, assistant controller of legal metrology and the Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and began distributing them to the public. Releasing the pamphlets, president of the Bezwada Bar Association (BBA) Pilla Ravi observed that corruption was becoming rampant in all fields. “Unfortunately, courts too are no exception,” he said. Comparing the spread of corruption with that of HIV, Mr. Ravi said it was hampering the nation’s development. Mr. Ravi felt that the Right to Information (RTI) Act would in some measure contribute to minimising corruption. P. Sai Babu of FLASH and senior advocates were present.
