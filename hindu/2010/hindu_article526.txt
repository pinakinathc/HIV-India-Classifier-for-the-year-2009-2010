City-based non-governmental organisation Vasavya Mahila Mandali (VMM), in association with the Krishna district employment exchange, on Friday organised a job mela on the premises of its office near Benz Circle. The event was conducted exclusively for children hailing from HIV-affected families or orphans who are beneficiaries of the welfare schemes being implemented by the VMM. “A major chunk of the participants were vulnerable children, either affected by AIDS or orphans. Nearly 180 children who had passed eighth, ninth or tenth classes, had their names enrolled in short-term courses like DTP and housekeeping, being offered under Rajiv Udyogasri programme,” said B. Keerthy, technical support manager of the VMM. Assisted by VMM volunteers, a team of six department personnel guided the children how to fill up their application forms. Photo copying facility was available on the premises to spare the children any possible inconvenience. “The children can expect their employment cards in the next two or three days,” said Ms. Keerthy, informing that for the first time, the employment exchange wing had carried out mobile registrations for job-seekers.
