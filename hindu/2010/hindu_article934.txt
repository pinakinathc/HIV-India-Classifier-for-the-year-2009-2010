A day after an HIV-affected woman succumbed to the disease, two inmates of the Destitute Rehabilitation Centre here have been admitted to K.R. Hospital. The condition of one of the inmates is said to be serious. While Kalamakar, a 60-year-old inmate, is suffering from a kidney problem, the other who is speech impaired, is being treated for tuberculosis. Hospital Superintendent Geetha Avadhani said Kalamakar suffered from malnutrition, anaemia and hyperaemia. His renal problem was in the early stages and he was responding to treatment. The other patient, who had had a stroke in the past, had been detected with tuberculosis. Doctors treating the speech-impaired inmate said his condition was serious, but was under watch in the emergency ward.
