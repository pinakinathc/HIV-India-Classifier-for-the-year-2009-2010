Students of Vignan University sign expressing solidarity with HIV/AIDS campaign in Guntur on Tuesday. Â   For the scores of students who turned up at the awareness talk on HIV/AIDS on the eve of World AIDS Day, the experience turned out to be a `positive' one as Additional DMHO P. Uma Devi dispelled several myths over the syndrome. Sharing her experiences of over a decade of overseeing the AIDS/Leprosy awareness activities in the district, Dr. Uma Devi said that awareness sessions with adolescent girls in schools and colleges had had the desired result. The sessions were in tune with the theme of the first World AIDS Conference held in New York in 1991. She said that the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) Phase 1 was implemented at a time when there was no effective treatment and the emphasis was only on prevention. But by the time, the NACP-2 was implemented; the situation had changed with the introduction of Ant Retro Viral (ART) Therapy and a new hope was kindled in the lives of the People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). But the ART treatment could commence only when the CD-4 count was below the normal limit. Dr. Uma Devi complimented the NSS Unit of Vignan University for coming forward to start student clubs. Vice-Chancellor of Vignan University V. Govadhana Rao said that the University had taken HIV/AIDS awareness activities as part of its social responsibility tasks and promised his support in reaching out to vulnerable sections of the society. Later, the students signed on the banner expressing their solidarity in the campaign against HIV/AIDS. Prizes were distributed to students who won in various competitions. Registrar, A. Leela Mohan Rao, NSS Officer Krishna Kumar and Media Manager Gopalakrishna were present.
