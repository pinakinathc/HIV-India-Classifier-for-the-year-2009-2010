Bellary stands second in the State in institutional deliveries under the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPCT) programme. Sixty-two pregnant women with HIV have given birth at VIMS Hospital in Bellary from January to November this year. Vani Vilas Hospital in Bangalore has recorded 77 such deliveries, the highest in the State, according to Dr. Narasimhamurthy, District Programme Officer of the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit. “We have just got the message that Bellary has got the second place in the State and that an award will also be given at a State-level function being held at Bangalore on December 1 to observe World AIDS Day,” he told   on Tuesday. According to him, all pregnant women were tested for HIV under the PPCT programme, and those found positive were given the option to choose a hospital where they wanted to deliver the baby. Similarly, the Primary Health Centre at Raravi in Siruguppa taluk has been selected for the award among the lower referral hospitals, where three HIV-infected pregnant women were admitted for delivery, he said.
