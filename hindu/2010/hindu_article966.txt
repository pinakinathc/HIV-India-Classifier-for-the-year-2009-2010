Subramanyam    Faith Home for Children, Adoni, a pioneer in running a shelter for HIV positive children, has instituted an interesting award to inspire students, teachers and parents of government schools to come out with the best. The best performing school award was aimed at motivating government schools to improve performance and alter the outlook of the general public about government schools. Only the children of the lowest strata of the society were filling the government schools. No middle class or educated family sent its children to government schools. In fact, the government schools had the best teachers and huge infrastructure when compared to private schools. Yet the government schools failed to inspire the society to send their wards to them. Daniel Prem Kumar, convener of the committee which instituted the award, said the panel looked for punctuality among teachers, regularity, attendance and use of modern teaching aids. From the student side, the panel looked at participation in games, cultural events, extracurricular activities and educational standards. The school management aspects covered infrastructure, toilets, compound wall, playground, community participation in school activities. The attitude of the school management towards HIV positive children was also taken into consideration if they wanted enrolment. Out of 117 schools, 13 were shortlisted and two schools—Kilchinpet Municipal Elementary School, Adoni and MP Elementary School, Adoni Rural were adjudged as the best performing schools .
