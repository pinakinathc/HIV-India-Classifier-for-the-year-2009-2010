The district administration, in association with the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, is contemplating extending health insurance to people with HIV in the district. Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, B. Shivappa, Deputy Commissioner, who is also chairman of the district-level coordination committee for preventing HIV/AIDS, said that details were being worked out with a private insurance company and would be finalised soon. According to him, it was proposed to extend insurance cover to around 750 people with HIV in the first phase. The insurance company would meet the cost of treatment up to Rs. 15,000 a year. For paying the premium, which comes to around Rs. 11 lakh a year to cover 750 people, the district administration plans to contact philanthropists. “If everything goes according to the plan, Bellary will be the first district in the State to extend this facility,” Mr. Shivappa said. While stating that as many as 15,675 of over two-lakh people tested at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) proved to be HIV-positive in the district, Mr. Shivappa said the number was on the decline. The seropositivity rate among ICTCs had come down from 33.8 per cent in 2002 to 11.2 per cent in 2009. Similarly, in the Prevention from Parent to Child Transmission programme, the infection has stood at 0.6 per cent in 2009 from 1.64 per cent recorded in 2006. According to him, a total of 8,658 people with HIV — 4,647 men, 3,966 women and 45 transgenders — have registered with the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, of which 4,609 people with HIV — 2,607 men, 1,977 women and 25 transgenders — were getting medicines. In addition, 642 children with HIV — 364 boys and 278 girls — have registered with ART centres, of whom 265 are being given medicines. He also said that there had been a fall in infection among youth below the age of 25 and the prevention, care and support services had been scaled up. Awareness was being created through several non-governmental organisations such as MYRADA, Vimukti, Nityajeevan, Population Services International and World Vision. He said that World AIDS Day would be observed on December 1 with the focus on ‘Control of HIV/AIDS and Youth'. Dr. Narasimhamurthy, programme officer of the DAPCU, and Shrikant Basur, District Health Officer, were present.
