LOVE FOR KIDS: Children of Santhosha Nanban are treated to a sumptuous fare at the New Year celebrations organised by the Police Department in Puducherry. —   | Photo Credit:  Staff Reporter PUDUCHERRY: New Year celebrations are not always synonymous with partying or visiting temples and churches at midnight. Sometimes, a simple meal is by itself, a cause for joy. It certainly was, for the seventy children of Santhosha Nanban, who were treated to New Year cake and a simple lunch by the Police Department on Thursday. Their enthusiastic applause and poignant gratitude at the end of the meal, spoke of a good beginning of the New Year for them. “We have been taking abandoned children and street children under our wing for about 14 years” says Mangloren of Santhosha Nanban, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). “About 150-200 kids come to us every year, and many of them return to their homes after counselling. Those who do not have homes stay with us. We have tie-ups with other organisations, when it comes to HIV-affected children or mentally affected children who need special care,” she explains. The children, who stay on with the NGO, are educated in government schools and are taken care of. Those who were a part of the event showed remarkable discipline in the way they quietly lined up to collect their food, neatly collected their plates in disposable bags and cleaned the place at the end of the meal. They also received New Year gifts from officials of the Police Department. “Many of these children, especially the girls, have been abandoned by their parents. Even two days back, we rescued a two-day old baby girl from a dustbin. She is now recovering in hospital,” said B. Srikanth, Senior Superintendent of Police (Law and Order). “This New Year celebration is a gesture only to show them that someone does care for them,” he said.
