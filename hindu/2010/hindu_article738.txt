Desperate step: Dismissed staff nurses resort to begging in Hyderabad on Saturday.    About 200 contract staff nurses employed in various government institutions, who were sacked on July 1, resorted to begging here on Saturday to focus attention on their plight/demands and to protest the government's indifference to the nine-day-old relay hunger strike being organised by them. The protestors moved from RTC Crossroads to Indira Park seeking alms from passersby. Several of them managed to collect coins. They demanded immediate reinstatement, scrapping of third-party contractors, permanent jobs with security and weightage. According to M. Ravinder, CITU leader, the Government has done ‘injustice' to the nurses by utilising their services in the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients during the last five years and now summarily dismissed them. He demanded the Government's immediate intervention to ensure that the third-party contract system of recruiting contract staff is scrapped.
