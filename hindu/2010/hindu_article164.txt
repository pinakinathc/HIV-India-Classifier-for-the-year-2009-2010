Healthcare for the poor: Roberta Ritson of the World Health Organisation addressing a gathering at the global consulative meeting on ‘The Right to Health’ in Bangalore on Monday.   | Photo Credit:  Staff Reporter Bangalore: The long-pending Bill to tackle discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS has “reached finality” and will be tabled in the budget session of the Parliament, Law Minister Veerappa Moily said on Monday. Several differences of opinion had delayed the Bill and the conflicting views had now been reconciled, he told presspersons on the sidelines of the inaugural function of a three-day consultative meeting on “The Right to Health”. He also said that the law would soon get tough on corruption in the judiciary, with the replacement of the Judges Inquiry Act of 1968 with the new Judges Standard and Accountability Bill. The global consultative meeting on “The Right to Health” will focus on preventative and promotive healthcare for the poor, low and middle-income groups in an urban setting, he said. The urban poor — the majority of who live in slums — are more vulnerable to health risks than their rural counterparts, said Mr. Moily in his inaugural address. By the year 2030, 61 per cent of the world’s population will be in cities, he added. Roberta Ritson, World Health Organisation designated technical officer for Commonwealth Association for Mental Handicap and Developmental Disabilities (CAMHADD) said that the Right to Health must be approached from a human rights angle. “The Right to Health does not refer to healthcare services alone, but encompasses other determinants of health such as water, food, education, work conditions and environment,” she said. Delivering the keynote Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde said that efficiency of the healthcare sector was undermined by corruption. The consultative meet is being organised by the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in association with CAMHADD.
