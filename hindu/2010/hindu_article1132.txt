The funding by the international Global Fund Board — in response to a proposal by India — is to support the Union Health Ministry's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in eradicating tuberculosis (TB) in Karnataka. Recently, the Union Government signed an agreement with the Board under which it will receive grants of Rs. 609.9 crore from the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) to support AIDS and TB control programmes. Subsequently, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has applied for the Round 10 funding of the Global Fund. The project will broaden the scope of civil society involvement in TB services through an enduring national partnership to link RNTCP to other stakeholders through national and state coordination committees, a spokesperson for PSI said.
