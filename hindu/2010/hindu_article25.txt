Special Correspondent GULBARGA: Well-known physician and HIV/AIDS consultant Murugesh Pastapur said on Sunday that tuberculosis (TB) was becoming incurable once again, thanks to the HIV epidemic. Dr. Pastapur, who has published several research papers on various issues concerning HIV and AIDS, presented a paper on the emergence of TB as an incurable disease once again at the four-day 65th annual conference of the Association of Physicians of India held at Jaipur in Rajasthan from January 7. “Before 1950s TB was incurable and after 1950s, it became curable, and again now it is threatening to become incurable because of the HIV epidemic,” he told The Hindu. Dr. Pastapur said that because of the HIV epidemic, even the developed countries were experiencing the resurgence of TB. Overlapping of toxicities, drug-drug interaction, Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS), pill burden and difficulty in integrating the management programmes of TB and HIV at the national-level were the problems in preventing the re-emergence of TB a major disease. He said coordinating and balancing these programmes at the national-level and bringing in simpler guidelines at the grassroots were the most important factor to achieve success in the battle against the “deadly duo”. Dr. Pastapur said about one-third of those living with HIV globally had TB. Those living with HIV formed around 5 per cent of the new TB cases in India. In endemic countries, TB infection occurred in childhood. Because of robust immunity, it remained as latent infection and the lifetime risk of reactivation of latent TB in HIV negative person was 10 per cent, but in HIV positive persons, the risk was 10 per cent.
