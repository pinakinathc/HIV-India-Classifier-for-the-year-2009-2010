Narayanan said here on Friday that the law and order situation was much better in Kerala compared to some other States in the country. He was speaking after inaugurating the ‘Swamthanam' scheme of adopting 150 HIV-positive persons, organised jointly by the Janamaithri Suraksha Scheme of the Town South Police Station and Daya Charitable Trust. Mr. Narayanan said schemes like ‘Janamaithri Suraksha' had helped bring down the crime rate. These schemes were implemented with the cooperation of voluntary organisations and the people. Mr. Narayanan said diseases such as AIDS can be fought only with support from the grassroots level. “We have lot of poor people though India has made tremendous progress. There are a large number of people afflicted with HIV and blindness. It is a pity that they are left to the official agencies to look after. There should be cooperation between the public and private agencies to tackle this mammoth problem,” he said. “During this generation, we will be able to find effective medicines to fight AIDS. There should be legislation for treatment and providing all other assistance to AIDS patients,” he suggested. The West Bengal Governor said he would request the Chief Minister and the West Bengal government to implement schemes like ‘Janamaithri Suraksha.' T.K. Hamsa, MLA, special invitee to the function, said the Janamaithri Suraksha scheme was first implemented in Ottappalam municipality. This had helped bring down crime and accidents rates there.
