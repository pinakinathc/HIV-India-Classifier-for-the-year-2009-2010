Gopinathan    Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1, people living with HIV, sexuality minorities and transgenders came together on a common platform on Monday to assert that peer tactics and strategies play a key role in HIV prevention. At an interaction organised on Monday by the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), they alleged that professional counsellors appointed by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) in the Government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and Anti-Retroviral therapy (ART) centres were “indifferent” towards people who visited these centres for tests and treatment. “They do not understand that we are already facing stigma and discrimination in society. Their approach towards the infected people is crude that discourages us from continuing treatment. We demand that KSAPS appoint peer counsellors in every centre so that we get counselled by people who know our problems,” Thyagaraj, General Secretary of Karnataka Network for People living with HIV, said. Pointing out that provision of food and nutrition was essential for infected persons, Vijay Kumar from Sadhane, another group of the community, said most of the HIV deaths were owing to lack of nutrition. “Although we are getting free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, they are useless without proper nutrition. We try to mobilise foodgrains and other required items for the needy through our organisation at least for the first three months. But we want the Government to ensure that there is an assured regular supply,” he said. The other problems faced by HIV positive people included lack of free healthcare facilities.
