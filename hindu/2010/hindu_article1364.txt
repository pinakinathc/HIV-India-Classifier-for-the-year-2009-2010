Facility: The hospital set up to provide ART treatment for people with HIV by the Ayushman Trust at Wadi in Chitapur taluk.    Women with HIV appear to respond better to anti-retroviral treatment (ART), a multidrug treatment regimen that improves immunity among people with HIV. A sample study of those undergoing ART since 2007 at Ayushman Trust run by the ACC limited at Wadi, revealed that longevity of women with HIV was greater than men. Jagadish N. Kulkarni, who is overseeing the treatment facilities at the hospital set up by the Trust, told presspersons that while women with HIV adhered to advice given during counselling sessions and changed their lifestyle according to the ART treatment regimen, men seldom changed their habits. Dr. Kulkarni said that women with HIV were stronger psychologically. Further, the “guilt factor” was lower among them, which was a reason for compliance with the treatment regimen. “Women with HIV never give up the treatment process. But the same cannot be said about men, many of who discontinue the ART regimen within a few months,” he said. This could be because they did not adhere to the advice, and hence found the treatment ineffective, he added. The Trust-run hospital has been a boon to those living with HIV in the region. Chitapur taluk has a high number of migrant labourers who are highly vulnerable. Dr. Kulkarni said that more than 5,000 people had undergone medical tests till now. So far, 560 have tested positive for HIV, he added. The hospital is the first in the district to have the CD-4 count testing machine, which indicates the immunity status of a person with HIV. However, a disturbing factor is that people undergoing ART has risen from 32 in 2007 to 147 in 2010. To a question, Dr. Kulkarni said that 6 per cent of patients undergoing ART had discontinued for various reasons and 8 per cent deaths had been reported.
