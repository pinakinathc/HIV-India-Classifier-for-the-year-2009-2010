Rapid behavioural changes among youth may contribute to formation of new epicentres of HIV-AIDS if stakeholders are not alert, said Lakshmi Bai, Project Director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI). Speaking at a ‘TAI workshop on script writing and filmmaking' here on Friday, she said, “There is a need for strong systems to educate the youth on managing change in lifestyle.” The workshop is part of a three-day youth carnival to be held from August 10 to 12 in Chennai. “We are targeting the youth and over 1.5 lakh of them will be covered under the carnival,” said Dr. Lakshmi Bai. Students from various colleges participated in the workshop and interacted with transgenders who had been creating awareness on HIV-AIDS. Shilpa, one of the transgenders, said that skill development had helped many of them make contributions to AIDS control. “We feel empowered now. We were taught skills of videography, catering and communication a few years ago,” said Karthik Priya, another transgender. “We are able to empathise well with our people. It helps us communicate the challenges faced by such people in a better way,” said Sandhya, another transgender. Films are a good medium to dispel myths and misconceptions about HIV-AIDS, said Alex Parimalam, an official of Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society. The workshop was an effort to tap the creativity of thousands of students in creating awareness on HIV-AIDS, said an official of TAI.
