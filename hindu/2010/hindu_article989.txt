On a crusade against HIV for nearly 10 years, Santosh Kumar Mishra believes only a sustained and vigorous campaign can yield results in the battle against the disease. Mr. Mishra, 43, rode into Kerala on his motorbike on Thursday after touring the length and breadth of India. He set out on his ‘Mission HIV, AIDS Awareness Campaign' on a bicycle from his native Guamal village in Orissa's Bhadrak district on August 15, 2001. In Kerala for the first time, Mr. Mishra who reached here from Mangalore interacted briefly with people at the Manjeswaram border check-post. “The disease can only be contained through a sustained and mass campaign by various sections of society,” Mr. Mishra told   here  He stressed the message of safe sex to free the globe from the HIV scourge. He also urged the authorities to free the roads of wayside hotels, popularly known as dhabhas, which, according to him, facilitate unsafe sex among the public, especially truck drivers. Mr. Mishra campaigns against HIV by distributing pamphlets and literature in regional languages in coordination with local AIDS control societies and hospitals. He also visits industrial units and colleges to spread awareness of HIV and AIDS.
