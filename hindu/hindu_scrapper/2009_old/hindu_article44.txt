Special Correspondent SALEM: Collector Chandrakumar has urged the general public and motorists to strive hard to make Tamil Nadu an accident-free State at the earliest. Inaugurating the week-long Road Safety celebration of the State Transport Corporation here on Thursday, he said that it was the wish of the Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi that Tamil Nadu, which has been witnessing a sharp increase in road accidents, should shrug off that dubious distinction. The Collector insisted on a complete awareness on road safety among the general public. “The drivers should have patience. When you lose it, you end up in accidents,” he cautioned. Salem district had recorded 2,798 deaths during last year. Later, he distributed handbills on road safety awareness to the public. The week-long programme would include yoga classes for bus crew, eye test for drivers, HIV awareness, banners and buntings on road safety, screening short films on accidents and road safety to drivers, awareness for public and students about the traffic rules and road usage, fixing reflectors in bullock carts and other vehicles, an awareness rally and elocution competitions for school students on traffic rules. Officials including Assistant Commissioner of Police Senkodan, Regional Transport Officers K. Umasakthi, Transport Corporation General Manager Dhanasekaran, Corporation Commissioner K. S. Palanisamy, Public Relations Officer T. Manoharan and others, participated in the function.
