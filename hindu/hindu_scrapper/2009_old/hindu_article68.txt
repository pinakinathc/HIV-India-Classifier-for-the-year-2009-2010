Staff Reporter BHUBANESWAR: In a bid to contain spreading of HIV/AIDS epidemic, Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS) was emphasising on training of peer educators (PEs) who could convince people about safe practices. At the three-day State level peers’ conference that concluded here on Friday, OSACS project director Parameswar Swain laid stress on strengthening the outreach activities by primarily engaging peers in self assertiveness and responsible action for mobilising community and networking across the project area. More than 200 peers from across the State participated in the conference and shared their experience. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) is an important tool prescribed in National AIDS Control Programme, Phase-II (NACPII) to bring about perceptible change among vulnerable section of population. “PE led outreach activity could help in increased identification of vulnerable groups, saturation of the coverage and access to services. This also establishes as a norm for the involvement of the community in making decisions for all activities concerning them,” Mr. Swain said. He said the conference would be beneficial in building organic linkages among the members of the community and among core population like female sex workers, men having sex with men and different targeted intervention projects under OSACS. “The process of community mobilisation and involvement would increase the responsibility and accountability of community members in managing HIV/ AIDS prevention project,” OSACS project director said. Among others Bhagaban Prasad consultant National AIDS Control Organisation, Basanta Mohanty State director of international voluntary organisation, CARE and A. K. Sen from UNICEF were present on the occasion.
