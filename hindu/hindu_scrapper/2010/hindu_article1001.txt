Fifty student volunteers from 10 schools in the district, preparing to campaign against the spread of HIV/AIDS and drug abuse will begin their three-day intensive training programme in the first week of October in an initiative by the Rotary Club of Cochin Queen City and Centre for Advanced Projects and Solutions (CAPS). Baby Thomas, president of the Rotary Club of Cochin Queen City, said that five students each had been selected from the 10 schools enlisted for the programme in the first phase. In the final phase, there will be 30 students each from the schools, who will engage in a variety of public activities to raise awareness against drug abuse and spread of HIV/AIDS.
