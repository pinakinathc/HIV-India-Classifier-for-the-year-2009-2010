I n memory of a friend, a team of youngsters started a non-profit organisation two years back in an effort to extend their help to the underprivileged children and support HIV affected children. “We lost our friend Sandeep Kumar in a tragic accident and ever since then we wanted to start something in his remembrance,” said G. Sindhu who along with her brother G. Sandeep and D. Gautham started the non-profit organisation V Care in the year 2008. After two eventful years, V Care has 90 registered members working for it, supporting 90 children in four different organisations across the city. Apart from supporting children and looking after their food, education and health expenses, V Care has also been part of blood donations camp and fund raising events for the flood victims. They celebrated their first anniversary with a fund raising event which was attended by 1200 guests. In continuation with their annual activity, V Care is organising another fund raising event on January 22 as a part of their second anniversary celebrations. The evening will include performances by singers and dancers from popular television shows. Acrobats Diwakar and Sonia from the reality show India's Got Talent and Harinath Reddy and his dance troupe will be performing at the event. Sand Animation by Manas Kumar Sahu is also another highlight for the evening. The proceedings of the event will be donated for the welfare of the under privileged children. The event will take place at the Hari Hara Kala Bhavan. For details contact 98859 88533, 98853 91691.
