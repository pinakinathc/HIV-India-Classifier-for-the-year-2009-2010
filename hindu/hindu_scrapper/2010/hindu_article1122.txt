A Link Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre was opened at the Coimbatore Central Prison on Saturday to distribute drugs to HIV positive prison inmates as part of a project by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. B. Mohamed Ali, District Project Manager of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit and Additional Superintendent of Prisons, Ravindran attended the function. Dr. Mohamed Ali said that there were 37 nodal centres in the State that provided testing and treatment. Coimbatore Medical College Hospital was the nodal centre in Coimbatore. There are centres at Pollachi, Valparai and Karamadai. The Coimbatore nodal centre on an average gets 200 patients a day. ART centres can help reduce the pressure at nodal centre. The Central Prison as on date has 22 HIV positive patients. Now they need not be taken to hospital to get drugs. It will help save time and money. At present, the prisoners have to be taken to hospital under police escort.
