Staff Correspondent BELLARY: J. Shanta, MP, has urged sex workers to avail themselves of the benefits of the welfare schemes of the Government to not only become self-reliant and improve the standard of living, but also to ensure a good education for their children. Addressing a gathering, after inaugurating Soukhya Women's Conference â€“ 2010, here on Saturday, said that the Government had introduced several welfare schemes for women such as dairy development and cottage industries with loan facilities and subsidies. Women should make the best use of these opportunities, she said. The conference was organised by the Soukya Belaku Community Service Organisation, a wing of MYRADA, and the Department of Health for women sex workers from various parts of the district. Bellary Zilla Panchayat president N. Rudragouda said that the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS was on the decline in the district. At present, the district ranked sixth in the State. Organisations such as MYRADA could work with women sex workers to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and ensure a healthy society, he said. Mr. Rudragouda also urged women to make optimum use of the Government loan schemes: they could get a loan Rs. 50,000 at 4 per cent interest, he said. Devanand, Director, Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), stressed the need for women sex workers to insist upon the use of contraceptives to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS. He urged them to cooperate the Health Department and non-governmental organisations to fight against HIV/AIDS. Rita of MYRADA welcomed the gathering and B.M. Mahesh proposed a vote of thanks.
