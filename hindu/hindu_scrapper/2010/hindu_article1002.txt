“The complexities faced by the education sector today are the consequences of capitalistic economic policies adopted by the Government in the name of reforms. Only the policies guided by Socialist principles can help overcome these complexities and fulfil the dream of education for all,” Krishna Chakravarti, Polit Bureau member, Socialist Unity Centre of India (C) has said. Addressing the valedictory function of the State-level convention of the All-India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) here on Monday, Mr. Chakravarti said that instead of taking the responsibility of ensuring education for all, the Government was trying to hand over the education sector to players in the market. Education would become a global saleable commodity and the privilege of a handful of persons if people failed to oppose the Government's policies on education, he said. The convention selected the new State committee on the occasion. The office-bearers are V.N. Rajashekhar (president); B. Ravi, G. Hanumensh, Mahesh, N.M. Sharma and Gangadhar Badiger (vice-presidents); and Pramod (secretary).
