Special Correspondent VIJAYAWADA: One person is dying of tuberculosis every third minute in the country due to poor awareness, though it can be cured completely, according to Additional District Medical and Health Officer T.V.S.N. Sastry. World TB Day Addressing a meeting held to observe the World TB Day jointly by the Automobile Technicians Association (ATA) and the Population Services International (PSI) here on Thursday, Dr. Sastry said there was a close relationship between TB and HIV. As many as 60 per cent of HIV patients get infected by TB. While there were 10 lakh HIV patients suffering from TB, another 10 lakh people not suffering from HIV were also having TB, he said. ATA secretary M.A. Khaliq, president V. Diwakara Rao, IALA Assistant Commissioner D. Sudhakar, APIIC Zonal Manager P. Satyanarayana, PSI area manager G.K.P. Ravi Chandra and other spoke. Mr. Ravi Chandra said that the PSI was an NGO that was aided by the USAID with projects in 65 countries. Its AIDS/HIV deputy project manager John Timothy Naiker said that TB, just like leprosy, was a “stigma discrimination” disease that leaves patients thoroughly demoralised. School children and the families of people working in Autonagar enjoyed a nice cultural programme that highlighted the dangers of TB and the benefits of DOTS, the new therapy of the disease.
