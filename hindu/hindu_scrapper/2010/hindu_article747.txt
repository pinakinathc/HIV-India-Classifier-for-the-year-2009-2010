Creative pursuit: Dr. K. Shyamsunder with his books in Karimnagar.    He is a clinical pathologist by profession. But, he writes thought-provoking poems and songs on various social issues with as much passion as his commitment towards his patients. Meet Dr Kanapa Shyamsunder, the IMA State secretary, born in Aleru village of Mahabubnagar district. A 1980 batch MBBS student of Osmania Medical College and with DCP (diploma in clinical pathology) in 1992, Hyderabad, he has developed a passion for writing as a hobby after seeing the social issues. He has written his first book titled ‘Hithapatham' in the year 2008 with inspiration from eminent poet Dr. Malayasri. Again in 2009, he bought out another book titled ‘Kranthipatham' with the compilation of various poems. He had tried to create awareness among readers about various diseases such as AIDS etc in his poems. He also explained the plight of Sircilla weavers in a touching poem. He has also written some poems on rivers and IMA and APNA (Andhra Pradesh Private Nursing Homes and Hospitals Association). When he was associated with IMA Karimnagar district, there was no programme without the songs of Dr. Shyamsunder. He is also planning to bring out a health magazine for the benefit of rural folk about the importance of protection from various diseases very soon. Dr. Shyamsunder has the credit of imparting job-oriented lab-technician courses to the rural youth through Siddartha Educational Society as his pathological centre in the town.
