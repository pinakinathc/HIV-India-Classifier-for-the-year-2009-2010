The Chennai Corporation plans to ban students of Chennai Schools from attending rallies for non-educational purposes. Sources in the civic body said such rallies only led to the students missing their classes and making them tired. “We will place a resolution before the Corporation Council for its approval,” the source said. Students of middle, high and sometimes even higher secondary standards are asked to participate in rallies and various campaigns including, those against child labour, smoking, HIV/AIDS and even admission to schools. The civic body has a total of 67 high and higher secondary schools and 122 middle schools. The headmistress of a Chennai School said that students of class 6, 7 and 8 are not sent to very far off places. “On working days, children are sent for such campaigns only after 3 p.m. and to nearby localities. We do not waste entire days unless it is absolutely necessary,” she said. A teacher in an aided school in nearby Tiruvalluvar district said students participated in rallies including those for new schemes under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Equitable Standard School Education and Education Development Day. “Such rallies are taken out on instruction from the Department. Though the children get tired, we ensure that we get them something to eat and drink after the rally,” the teacher said.
