Munch to win: Let the race begin PHOTO: K.R. DEEPAK    For the 50 children of Francois-Xavier Bagnoud India (FXB) Suraksha, it was one of the best days of their lives. “I have never had so much fun,” said a beaming six-year-old Geetha, who is an HIV positive child. Like her, many HIV positive children had a day out at Vaisakhi Jala Udyanam at a programme organised by Spark, an organisation of students from Gayatri Vidya Parishad, recently. Several events like drawing competition, dancing, singing, musical chair, spoon race and biscuit race were held for the children as part of the social activities conducted by Spark. The 24 core team members cheered the bunch of kids who enjoyed themselves during the day-long event. Accompanied by their parents, the little ones took part in the events with enthusiasm. It was an emotional moment for many of the parents, who captured the event on camera. The event was organised with the support of sub-juniors of GVP College, Razzmatazz and FXB India Suraksha. Spark, a group started by the final year students of GVP, conducts similar activities every month. The members believe that it gives a sense of purpose to them and also immense satisfaction to spend time with the less privileged section of the society.
