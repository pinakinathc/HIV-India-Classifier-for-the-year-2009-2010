Anand Chandrasekaran    Use of mobile phones and the applications available in it are so common now that mobile internet is emerging as a new medium for innovative business models. Anand Chandrasekaran, Director at Openwave Systems in the U.S., spoke to M. Soundariya Preetha on the business potential for mobile internet technology. Mr. Chandrasekaran holds an MS in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and founded Aeroprise Inc. He was involved in the production of the documentary on HIV/AIDS “Tapestries of Hope” and has been recently recognised by the World Economic Forum as “Young Global Leader”. Mr. Chandrasekaran, who specialises in mobile internet, says ways to innovate in this space “excites” him. He has built personalised mobile applications at Aeroprise. One of the largest growing industries within the mobile internet space is mobile advertising. There is so much history about the user of a mobile application that the database can be tapped for business opportunities. For instance, when a mobile user reads a news report on his mobile, there is data on the area of interest of the reader and the subjects that he reads about. Thus, the content can be developed to give value addition to the loyal customer. At the global-level, there is interest among several stakeholders in tapping the potential of this new medium. A number of countries have leveraged the data and voice side of mobile. Some of the applications are developed only for the mobile space now. In mobile internet space, with the new features there is unlimited data, user experience and various applications. Mobile technology has enabled the users to share several incidents in their life with their family and friends. “Mobile has become a bridging factor,” he says. Thus, the potential for mobile technology is huge though it will have its own growth issues. Concerns such as privacy need to be addressed, he says.
