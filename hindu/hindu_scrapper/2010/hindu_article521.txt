Senthil is a hair-dressing specialist just like any other hair dresser. But for those who know him well, he is a skilled artisan. Mr. Senthil is a specialist in creating figurines from chalk pieces. A polio-affected person, Mr. Senthil has deft hands, in not only giving a good hair cut, but also making dainty and beautiful-looking statues from a simple chalk piece. Asked about his passion for this art form, he said: “for many people, a chalk piece is nothing but an instrument used for marking on a black board, whereas for me, it is a material from which good figures could be etched.” He further says: “From my school days itself I was interested in making models using chalk pieces, which gradually became my hobby. Looking after his father's saloon shop, Mr. Senthil indulges in his chalk art during his spare time. He says: “For making chalk art, a small pin and chalk pieces are enough, but the only problem is at times I have to waste many chalk pieces because of the fragile nature of the material. I have made hundreds of figures from chalk pieces, including the figures of the present Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran and Dravida Kazhagam founder E.V. Periyar." "My greatest satisfaction was when an organisation working for HIV-AIDS persons requested me to makemodels from chalk pieces for collecting funds. I presented 75 chalk art models as mementos free of cost,” says Mr.Senthil. Jaya Saloon is located at 12, 70-feet Road, Jawahar Nagar. Mr. Senthil can be contacted at 90948 77100. R. SRIKANTH
