As she could not bear the social boycott by family members and villagers, M. Lakshmi, 28 years old, allegedly committed suicide after killing her four-year-old child Hemalata in Mettavalasa of Laveru Mandal on Friday night. According to locals, Lakshmi's husband Sriramulu Naidu died due to AIDS four years ago. Later, it was found that she had also become a victim with the HIV. She hanged herself as all family members went to pilgrimage a few days ago. Villagers, who found the two bodies, conducted last rites without even informing the police. Laveru Sub Inspector Satyanarayana said no one had lodged complaint about the deaths and the last rites were completed even before the police reached the village.
