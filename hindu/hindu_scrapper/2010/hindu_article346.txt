He was addressing a function here on Saturday organised in connection with the fourth anniversary of the current district panchayat. “Local bodies should actively work for the emancipation of the weaker sections of the society. The project proposals should reflect the changing needs of the community. They should become role models with local-specific welfare projects,” he said. Congratulating the Thrissur district panchayat for its overall performance, the Minister said it had achieved tremendous progress in the production sector. “There have been efforts to generalise isolated shortcomings in the functioning of local bodies in the State. In the last decade the local bodies have proved their efficiency. Kerala has become a model in decentralisation in the country.” District panchayat president Ambadi Venu said that successful interventions of the district panchayat had rejuvenated the agriculture sector. He said a master plan for the development of the Thrissur District Hospital had been prepared by the district panchayat. Revenue Minister K.P. Rajendran inaugurated an exhibition organised in connection with the anniversary celebrations. P.C. Chacko, MP, distributed musical instruments to cultural groups belonging to the Scheduled Castes community. Therambil Ramakrishnan, MLA, distributed financial aid under various housing schemes.
