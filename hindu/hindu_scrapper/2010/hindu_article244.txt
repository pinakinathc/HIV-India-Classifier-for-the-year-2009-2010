Rajesh Ramakrishnan Â   The CSI calendar is different! Child Survival India (CSI), an organisation that strives to improve the quality of life of people in villages and slum clusters through HIV/AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health and women empowerment has launched a calendar unlike any other in 2010. Conceptualised by Rajesh Ramakrishnan, EVP (Marketing) with Frito Lay, a division of Pepsico, the calendar features well-known artistes caught in different emotions. He managed to rope in Juhi Chawla, Kay Kay Menon, Konkona Sen Sharma, Shreyas Talpade, Chitrangada Singh, Sivamani, Pradeep Sarkar, Usha Uthup, Divya Dutta, Simone Singh, Nandana Sen, Sona Mohapatra, Balki, Prahlad Kakkar and Ashwin Mushran. All 15 have been shot in natural light with minimal props and regular clothes. The calendar also has a unique design that allows the pictures to be flipped and changed depending upon your mood for the day.
