KARTHIKEYAN.    : Massive awareness of HIV/AIDS among youth is essential as young people are vulnerable to it, according to Collector M. Vallalar. He was inaugurating a district-level ‘Ilavattam,' a youth sports and cultural carnival at the district sports stadium near the Collectorate here on Tuesday. Youth aged between 15 and 24 constituted around 19 per cent of the population in the state. A recent study revealed that around 73 per cent of young people has misconception about modes of HIV transmission and much of young people's vulnerability stemmed from the poor access to correct information. Gender imbalances, societal norms and economic dependence contributed much to the risk of young people, he said. What was pathetic thing was that innocent children were affected by HIV, owing to blunders committed by their parents. Youth should not yield to cheap thrills that would spoil their health and life, he advised. The main objective of the carnival was to normalise HIV among youth and help them understand their vulnerability to this disease. It would also help youth build leadership and catalyse to fight HIV and AIDS. It would be a unique opportunity for the youth to exhibit their skills and talents. The Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society has plans to create 500 new Red Ribbon Clubs across the state during this carnival. Already, 986 colleges in the state had RRCs. Dindigul district alone has 35 clubs. In his special address, Joint Director of Health Services T. Jayabal said that HIV test was conducted on 9,783 persons in the district of which 1,197 were affected by HIV. They should choose the right path to lead a happy life. Thousands of students from various colleges and schools in the district took part. Winners of various sports activities will be sent to Chennai to take part in the state-level carnival scheduled in August.
