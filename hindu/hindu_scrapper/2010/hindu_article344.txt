CREATING AWARENESS:Students taking out a rally on World Tuberculosis Day in Tuticorin. Â   Staff Reporter Tuticorin: The Kalaignar Health Insurance scheme serves its purpose for people who cannot afford surgical and life saving treatments. The scheme is immensely beneficial to the have-nots, according to the Minister for Social Welfare, P. Geetha Jeevan. Addressing the world Tuberculosis day here on Saturday, she said that the severity of TB, considered a dreadful disease in those days, had been mitigated drastically by adopting various measures by the health care professionals. The district had recorded 87 per cent cure rate. In 2009, the diagnosed TB patients were 2,102 and 97 per cent of them had been screened for HIV. The patients diagnosed with TB had to undergo treatment continuously for a period of six months and the disease could be cured. People with low resistance and poor health conditions should have nutritious food to get rid of anaemic conditions, she added. Annual magazine of TB was released by the Minister and Mayor R. Kasthuri Thangam received the first copy. Financial assistances through welfare schemes were extended to beneficiaries on the occasion. P. Gurudevi, RDO, presided over the programme. P.
