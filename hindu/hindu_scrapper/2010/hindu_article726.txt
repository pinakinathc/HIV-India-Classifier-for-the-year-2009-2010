: The adidas Jobulani ball used in the FIFA World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands has been auctioned off on eBay to a football fan for £48,200. According to reports, more than 130 auction bids were placed for the ball, which had an initial price of £99. The money will be given to former South African President Nelson Mandela's 46664 charity promoting education, training and research in Africa to relieve child poverty and AIDS. The Jabulani was developed at UK's Loughborough University, and was the official match ball for the tournament in South Africa. The ball is made from eight spherically moulded panels and has a textured surface intended to improve aerodynamics. However, the ball received extensive criticism from players and coaches before and during the World Cup, who said the path of the ball through the air was unpredictable. “The interest in this particular piece seems not only heightened by the controversy surrounding it, but also the proceeds benefiting such a great cause,” Ruth Szyszkowski, an eBay spokeswoman, was quoted as saying. — ANI
