Staff Reporter BANGALORE: There are four major issues confronting HIV/AIDS-affected children in Karnataka: severe lack of nutrition, the discontinuance of education, children becoming care providers when mothers are infected, and their inheritance rights taken away if they are orphaned. These major points were made by Shanta Sinha, Chairperson, National Rights for Protection of Child Rights (NRPCR), who said that the country needed a comprehensive child health policy, which looked at HIV/AIDS as well. The observations were made at a public hearing on “Child rights – issues and entitlements of the orphan and vulnerable children (OVC) affected/infected by HIV/AIDS” organised jointly by the NRPCR and the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) at Christ University here on Friday. In fact, it was decided by the KSCPCR to hold these kind of public hearings at the taluk and district-level with the participants being all the stakeholders including government departments, NGOs, children and their parents. Close to 22 children with their parents/guardians/caretakers narrated their experiences and problems as HIV/AIDS affected/infected, and much of their problems had to do with the social stigma around them and their families, which often forced them to leave their schools. Moreover, with many of them orphaned, their parents’ ration cards were denied to them, and their rights to inherit property too.
