Speaking on the occasion, Mr.Munianathan recalled of times, when transgenders were subject to social taboos to the present time, where an exclusive welfare board exists for their welfare. Like other representative boards, transgenders have their own welfare board and it was up to them to seek membership to avail of schemes conceived for them. Further, under Magalir Thittam, transgenders were provided with revolving funds like other groups for initiating activities of economic sustenance. It required initiative from them to constitute themselves into self help groups and avail of revolving funds on line with womens' SHGs, Mr.Munianathan said. The programme, that envisaged to provide a platform to the socially stigmatised and ostracised group-transgenders, sex workers, and homosexuals, found an appreciative audience.
