Ravichandran released Tuberculosis seal at the Collectorate here on Monday in the presence of P. Subbiah, Deputy Director of Medical Services (TB), District TB centre. Tuberculosis is an air-borne disease which spreads when a patient coughs or sneezes. The Anti- Tuberculosis Association is playing a pivotal role in containing this dreadful disease. Even though the major financial support was provided by Central and State governments, a part of the contribution was provided by the Anti – TB Association through the sale of TB seal. It is scientifically proven that diabetes patients and HIV-infected patients were prone to the disease. In Tuticorin district, 2,102 patients had been diagnosed with TB and treated during the last fiscal, Dr. Subbiah said. Citing the precautionary measures to be followed by people, he advised them to close their mouth with handkerchief or any cloth while coughing or sneezing and appealed not to spit at public places. If the patients were identified with symptoms of TB like cough for over two weeks, evening rise of temperature and weight loss, it was essential for them to undertake sputum examination, he added. Officials and health care professionals were present.
