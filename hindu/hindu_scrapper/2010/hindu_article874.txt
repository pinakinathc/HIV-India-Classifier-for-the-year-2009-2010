The Rajasthan Government has sought the Centre's intervention for controlling the prices of 354 life-saving drugs, including those used for treatment of cancer and AIDS, listed by the World Health Organisation. The check on rising prices will also curb monopolistic practices of drug manufacturers. In a letter addressed to the Union Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, State Principal Medical and Health Secretary B. N. Sharma has emphasised the need for including the 354 medicines in the Drugs Price Control Order promulgated under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The number of drugs listed under the Order at present is 74. Mr. Sharma has stated that these medicines should be “brought within the ambit of the Drugs Price Control Order without delay”.
