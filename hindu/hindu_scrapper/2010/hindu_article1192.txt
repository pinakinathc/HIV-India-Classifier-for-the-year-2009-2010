The third national conference of AIDS Society of India has laid emphasis on comprehensive HIV management and affordable medicines. The three-day conference being attended by 600 delegates from India and 30 from abroad representing doctors, researchers, stakeholders and pharma companies, was inaugurated by Chief Minister K. Rosaiah here on Friday. Appreciating the organisers for holding the conference in the city, Mr. Rosaiah said that the State was hit hard by the HIV virus and it was one of the formidable public health problems. However, in the last few years, thanks to a sustained campaign on detection of HIV cases and efficiency of prevention programme, the numbers showed a downward trend, he said. About 80,000 people were receiving free Anti Retro-Viral Treatment (ART) from 43 government healthcare facilities, compared to just 1,000 people in 2004-05. The government was committed to universalising access to the ART. “We are confident of halting and reversing the epidemic in the State,” he said. Apart from clinical care, the government had introduced several schemes for the benefit of People Living with HIV (PLHIV), specially mitigating their financial burden. Pensions were sanctioned to PLHIVs and double nutrition and special nutrition wards were proposed for HIV-affected children.
