Charity begins at this Home. It comes as a big surprise in a significant development to broaden the perspectives of the children living with HIV/ AIDS at Heaven's Gate at Thailapuram in Sathankulam. Operational since October 2006, the Home provides moral support with a blend of parental affection to children abandoned by their parents. Eighty three children , aged six to 22, at the Home set amid a lush green field are studying at schools nearby. With no government financial support, P. Sam Thangiah, who manages the home, said that donor funding had not been enough to meet all the needs, especially career, of the little ones. To weed out social discrimination and resultant depression, the Home has a facilitator to impart spiritual counselling and instil a sense of belonging. Anti-retroviral treatment for the inmates was being provided by Government Hospital periodically. The children were being encouraged to play a variety of games including cricket, volley ball and taken for outings. “Political leaders have already paid frequently visits here but they are yet to pledge their support for development and maintenance. Provision of subsidised rice from the government for the inmates has become imperative,” Mr. Thangiah rued. Chief Educational Officer P. Vishnu Prasad, who visited the inmates, insisted upon the need for equality in society and said these children should never be ostracised. In a show of solidarity with them, he joined them for lunch following prayers. Advocating the need for motivation, he shared varied experiences with them to empower their inner spirits.
