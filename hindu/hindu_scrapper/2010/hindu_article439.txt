In the 1980s, Chettipedu was the kind of place you'd expect to find fragments of Stone Age implements. Thirty km from Madras, this village was unknown beyond those who lived or owned land there. We went there 25 years ago, to manage an estate. Since then, it has been home. He specialised in estate management, and we have had the experience of living in similarly desolate places in Sri Lanka and Karnataka. Therefore, I was not appalled at his decision. In fact, any decision on any matter he takes goes well with me. From the early days of our marriage, we have thought alike on almost every issue. As he has 12 siblings, and I have seven, many members of our extended families areliving in Chennai, it is natural to think that we're, at times, tempted to leave Chettipedu. But, we never are. Even our four children, who love us deeply, could not get us to move to Chennai. In time, they respected our decision and gave up. I am 80, she is 76, and both are battling myriad ailments. I have undergone four surgeries for colon cancer and two for liver. I have undergone a bypass surgery and another major surgery, following a serious road accident in 1994 at Pappanacheri near Ponamallee. She has had knee replacements on both legs and surgeries for varicose vein. But even these have not forced us to move to Chennai. Zeline Because of these issues, we don't travel much. But, friends and relatives flock to our home. We don't want to burden anyone. We like to believe we are still young enough to take care of ourselves. In all situations, we maintain a positive frame of mind. When the doctors rejected chemotherapy, on account of my age, I urged them to go for it. Often, limitations exist only in the mind.
