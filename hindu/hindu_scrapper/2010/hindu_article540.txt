The Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) is observing World Blood Donors' Day on June 14 with various programmes. Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy will inaugurate the State-level programme in Kannur. Awards will be presented to the college which conducted the most number of voluntary blood donation camps as well as persons, both male and female, who voluntarily donated the maximum volume of blood. A blood donation camp will be organised by KSACS at the P. Krishna Menon Memorial College for Women in Kannur, in association with various government departments and the blood banks of the Kannur District Hospital, Thalassery General Hospital, Pariyaram Medical College and the Malabar Cancer Centre. Blood donation camps are being conducted on the day in all districts, while the Red Ribbon Clubs will organise awareness programmes on voluntary blood donation in colleges across the State. The focus of World Blood Donors' Day 2010 will be on young donors, with the slogan, “New blood for the world.” Young persons will be urged to contribute towards saving lives by donating blood and by encouraging other youngsters to become donors. The State Blood Transfusion Council, apart from raising awareness on the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion, will focus on the role that youth can play in moving towards 100 per cent voluntary blood donation.
