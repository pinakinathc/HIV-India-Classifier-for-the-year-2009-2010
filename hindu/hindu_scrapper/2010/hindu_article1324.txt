The spread of HIV is increasing in the north eastern States predominantly through sexual transmission and mother-to-child mode, cautioned Pradeep Kumar, the protagonist of the film, “Mr. India”. Mr. Kumar and director and producer of the film Haobam Paban Kumar were speaking at the Media Centre of the International film Festival of India (IFFI) here on Wednesday. Using the medium of cinema to highlight and raise awareness about the possibilities leading of a normal life among those living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) are the two documentaries from the region in the Panorama section of the 41st IFFI. While “Mr. India” gives an insight into the life of K.H. Pradip Kumar Singh who battled HIV to rebuild his life and sculpted his body, “Going the Distance” is a digital film in Nagamese by Tiainla Jamir revolving around the life of a woman living with HIV/AIDS.
