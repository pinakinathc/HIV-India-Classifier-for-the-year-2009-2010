With no cure available for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the focus has been on prevention and awareness creation. In Coimbatore, the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit has been working through Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs), Red Ribbon Clubs (RRCs) and with help from non-government organisations to meet the two objectives. Officials in charge of the drive say there are 27 ICTCs in the district, including one in the central prison. There is a mobile ICTC as well, which functions from a van that tours the district. Counsellors, lab technicians present at the ICTCs create awareness among the public. They test pregnant women for HIV or sexually transmitted infection after obtaining their consent. This is part of the â€˜Early Infant Diagnosis' programme, which is done within six months of pregnancy. If they are found positive, counselling and follow-up treatment starts to prevent parent to child transmission. The unit says it has tied up with all primary health care centres and sub centres to carry out the programme. After delivery, women, as part of ante-natal check-up are screened for HIV, and if found to be carriers, are referred to the ICTCs. The Coimbatore Control Unit, on an average, screens 6,000 persons a month. Of those, around 2,000 are pregnant women. The number of positive cases is around 60, says the doctor. The ICTCs also take care of condom distribution. The contraceptives are available at the 27 centres and common places like bus stand, railway station and places where people congregate. Condoms are available even at construction sites and industrial areas. To further the prevention and awareness creation activities, the Control Unit has groomed people in the community to act as peer leaders.
