VIJAYA BHASKAR    Counselling is more effective and is also the need of the hour in the fight against AIDS and HIV, Dr. N.T.R. University of Health Sciences' Vice-Chancellor I.V. Rao said on Friday. Inaugurating the three-day 34th national conference of the Indian Association for the Study of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS, Dr. Rao said that posters and advertisement were not enough to control the spread of AIDS. The experience of an aggressive anti-AIDS campaign in five cities in the United States was that counselling was more effective in checking the spread of AIDS than advertising and other means. This was because human beings play a very key role in the spread of the disease. Socio-economic conditions that were prevalent were also playing a big role in the spread of the disease. He said in these five major cities counselling was being used as the primary tool of checking the spread of the disease, giving less priority to advertisement campaigns and messaging. He called for a coordinated effort between government and non-government organisations to check the spread of HIV and AIDS. He stressed the need for special programmes for the education of people in professions that were prone to contracting AIDS. Experts should come out with recommendations on ways and means to educate members of the high risk groups, he said. Nagarjuna Hospitals chief Kodali Jaganmohan Rao, organising secretary of the conference P. Ram Babu, NACO technical expert T.L.N. Prasad and others spoke.
