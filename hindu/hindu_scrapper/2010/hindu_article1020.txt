Migrant labourers from 11 districts in Orissa would be targeted with lessons on HIV/AIDS and safe sex. This campaign is to be taken up from next month by Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS) with the assistance of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) from next month. It may be noted that migrant labourers are most HIV infection prone community in Orissa. Their prevalence has made Ganjam district of south Orissa most HIV/AIDS-affected region of the State . Speaking to  , project director of OSACS Alekha Chandra Padhihari these migrant labourers would be targeted while they start out in search of work outside the State. The migrant labourers of Ganjam, Gajapati, Bolangir, Khurda, Balasore, Sundargarh, Nabarangpur, Puri, Nuapada and Kalahandi districts would face this awareness campaign which would be based on information, education and communication. These migrant labourers of these districts would come across awareness campaigns related to HIV/AIDS and safe sex at their villages, bus stops, railway stations as well as at their place of employment. “We are also planning to provide them a kit which would contain awareness building booklets related to safe sex and some condoms,” Mr. Pudihari said. Efforts are on to print awareness building materials published by counterparts of OSACS in States like Gujarat and Maharashtra in Oriya so that the migrant labourers get detailed information about medical centres and other facilities in the place of their employment like Surat. Plans are on to provide addresses of de-addiction centres to the migrant labourers who may be addicted to drugs in the State where they are migrating. These drug addicts are also to be provided some needles also.
