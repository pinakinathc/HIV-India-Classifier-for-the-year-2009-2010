A Tuticorin-based Indian physician, who is pursuing a master's programme offered by the Woolf Institute in conjunction with the University of Cambridge, has won the 2010 Junior Chamber International (TOYP) Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World Award for Medical Innovation. Dr. Gifty Immanuel, who works in India, is studying a Jewish-Christian Relations programme via e-learning. Each year the award is presented to 10 people under 40 in various categories around the world for extraordinary service to their communities, a university release said. The JCI, which works in partnership with the United Nations, has honoured Dr. Immanuel in recognition of his contribution to public health and use of innovative medical knowledge to serve global communities. Dr. Immanuel was brought up in India, Africa and Arabia and is qualified in dentistry, medicine and public health. He has a range of academic qualifications from various universities, including Harvard. His current job entails control and management of emerging and re-emerging infections like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis-B and other communicable diseases. Dr. Immanuel said, “Coming from a country which has been the birth place of several religions, it was always my desire to understand religious tolerance and harmony. The programme provides a deeper understanding of the concept of dialogue and reconciliation. Inter-faith peace-making efforts learnt from this programme could be applied to real world scenarios.” “For a busy mid-career professional like me, e-learning gives total flexibility to study without interrupting regular working hours.” — PTI
