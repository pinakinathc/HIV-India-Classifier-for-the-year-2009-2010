Chief Executive Officer of Kodagu Zilla Panchayat A.B. Ibrahim has called upon government officials to take up awareness programmes on HIV/AIDS in rural areas. He was addressing a group of migrant labourers at the District Hospital here on Monday for generating awareness on the disease, a press release said. Covering the migrant population was a must as they were vulnerable, Mr. Ibrahim said. The camp was organised by the District Health Department and the District AIDS Control Cell. Unsafe sex was one of the main causes for the spread of HIV, and migrants had to resort to safe practices, Mr. Ibrahim said. Government and non-governmental organisations were working effectively in controlling HIV/AIDS in the State, he said. B.G. Anantashayana, Associate Editor of   a local daily published from here, who inaugurated the programme, noted that a large number of migrant labourers came to Kodagu every year and making them understand the adverse effects of the disease was welcome. Yathiraj, senior Labour Inspector, asked the migrant labourers present to utilise the facilities made available to them by the Government. Such persons could register their names at the Labour Department here to avail themselves of the benefits, including medical. As many as 1,770 construction workers had registered their names in the district, he added. Chief Commissioner of Scouts and Guides, Kodagu, K.T. Baby Mathew, mooted the idea of opening a separate health sub-centre in the district to organise programmes on HIV/AIDS.
