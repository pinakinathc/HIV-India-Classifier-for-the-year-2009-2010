Rajeshwara Chary    The concept of safe sex seems to have arrived in Adilabad going by the demand for condoms dispensed through the condom vending machines put up by the District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) at public places and in private medical shops. About 2,500 units of condoms are extracted from the five boxes placed at the bus and railway station and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) every day besides a similar number estimated to be sold through medical shops in Adilabad town. The decreased incidence of Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) during the current year also indicates the same. AIDS prevalence during the year stands at 1.31 per cent against a 10 year average of 2.27 per cent. “As condom promotion seems to be an effective way of controlling spread of AIDS we have launched a special programme during the recently concluded Pranahita Pushkarams. Demonstration on use of male condoms and awareness on female condoms is spread through the condom promotion van”, says Dr. N. Raju, Additional District Medical and Health Officer (Leprosy and AIDS Control), as he gives details of the special programme. The DAPCU has given a boost to the AIDS control programme in the high risk areas of Kagaznagar, Mancherial, Nirmal and Bhainsa in the district where female sex workers are active. Mancherial and Nirmal towns receive extra special attention due to the existence of homosexuals. Notwithstanding this encouraging scenario, there is need for something more to be done vis-a-vis AIDS control. The Department will soon place condom dispensing machines at roadside dhabas along the NH-7 for the benefit of truckers. It should also consider putting the boxes at certain urban public places like liquor outlets and bars. For, it is after a bout of drinking that many a victim of AIDS had thrown caution to winds.
