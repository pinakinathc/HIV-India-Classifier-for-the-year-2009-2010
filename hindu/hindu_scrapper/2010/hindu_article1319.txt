Chief Executive Officer of the zilla panchayat A.B. Hemachandra said on Friday that AIDS was spreading swiftly and it was high time to take steps to control it effectively. Presiding over a meeting to make preparations for World AIDS Day on December 1, he said that awareness rallies should not be confined to urban areas. They must be organised at the gram panchayat, hobli and taluk levels simultaneously, he said. He directed the District AIDS Control Officer, Dinakar, to take action in this matter. He said that the Deputy Director of Pre-University Education, Nagaraj, should organise essay writing and debate competitions and seminars for pre-university students of the district on AIDS awareness. Mr. Hemachandra said that a jatha would be flagged off from the IMA Hall at 3 p.m. on December 1. It would pass through various roads before assembling at Gopi Circle. A candle-light oath-taking programme would be organised. Street plays would be organised at important circles, bus-stands and colleges on that day, he said. He said that representatives of local associations and organisations, students and other general public should participate actively in the programme. District TB Control Officer Raghunandan said that 27 per cent of the people lacked proper information about AIDS. Coordinator of the National Service Scheme (NSS) of Kuvempu University Bhudha Naik, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Channabasappa, Parameshwar and Vinod, doctors, and officials of various departments were present.
