Kote and Hunsur taluks took out a protest rally in Mysore recently to show their discontentment over the decision of Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board to acquire their cultivable land. They have urged the district administration to cancel the acquisition notification issued by KIADB to acquire land in both the villages. Led by Raitha Krishikarmikara Sanghatane (RKS) and All India Democratic Students Organization (AIDSO), the villagers went in a procession from Kote Anjaneyaswamy Temple to the office of the Deputy Commissioner. Throughout the procession, protesters raised slogans against the KIADB for issuing notification for acquisition of land, which the farmers are cultivating for years and demanded patta (certificate of title to land) immediately. Later, the protesters submitted a memorandum to the Additional Deputy Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath. Addressing the farmers, District Secretary, RKS, M. Shashidhar accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government of appeasing industrialists and making the life of the farming community miserable through acquisition of fertile and cultivable land for industrial purposes. He criticised the government for sacrificing the interest of farmers in the name of ‘progress.' He said the government, which was bent on creating a land bank by acquiring one lakh acres and offer it to industrialists as assured during the recent Global Investors Meet, was making discreet attempts to acquire fertile land in Halladamanuganahalli and Chikkabeechanahalli villages without prior intimation. Besides that, KIADB had identified land to the extent of 700 acres in other parts of Hunsur taluk and was trying to notify it for industrial purposes, he alleged. M.K.
