Alcohol consumption in India is among the highest in South Asia, raising the potential of increased sexual risk and the subsequent spread of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, experts at a three-day world conference on alcohol and HIV that concluded here on Thursday. The conference called for community-based approaches for combating alcohol use and the resulting HIV transmission. A special emphasis was on the role of gender norms. The research emphasised the need for greater gender equality and to shift norms that place violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol. Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women's risk of gender-based and sexual violence is increased by their partner's alcohol consumption.
