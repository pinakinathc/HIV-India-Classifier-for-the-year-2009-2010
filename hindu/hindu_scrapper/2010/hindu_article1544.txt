Australia has committed Rs. 45 crore (10 million Australian dollars) to help strengthen the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS in the north-east. The commitment came during a five-day visit to the north-east by Australia's Deputy High Commissioner in India Lachlan Strahan. Coinciding with the World Aids Day on December 1, Dr. Strahan met beneficiaries of Australian-funded anti-HIV/AIDS projects in the north-eastern States. C. Shekhar Nambiar, Senior Adviser, Public Affairs and Cultural Relations of the Australian High Commission, said in a press release that the funds would come through AusAID, Canberra's overseas development assistance programme. The money supports a team of United Nations agencies working with civil society organisations, the State AIDS Control Societies, and the regional sub-office of the Centre's National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in Guwahati. The aim of the programme is to improve the ability of officials and NGOs in the region to fight HIV.
