As the country grapples with a “mixed burden” of diseases that beset the developing as well as developed countries, Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday said adequate research was needed to deal with the challenge of non-communicable and re-emerging diseases. Addressing the centenary celebrations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) here, Mr. Azad said as the country moved from a developing nation to the status of a developed one, it had to face the challenge of communicable, non-communicable and re-emerging diseases. “The health parameters of our population show a very wide range which reflects diversity of problems, lack of proper maternal and child healthcare facilities in a significant portion of the country and a large burden of morbidity due to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS.” Malaria after the initial success in 1960s and 1970s has become a killer disease again especially in the inaccessible tribal population. “Continued problems of diarrhoeal-diseases, respiratory infections, encephalitis, especially Japanese Encephalitis, dengue and chikungunya are major health threats today. Research carried out by ICMR Institutes show that even tribal populations of North-East and Orissa have hypertension as a major problem,” the Minister said. Mr. Azad said that while non-communicable diseases, including cancer, had already emerged as major threats, control of infectious diseases by using proper vaccination was still a matter of concern and constant operational research was required. He said the ICMR was concentrating on more than 50 such leads for development of new tools for vector control and diagnostic methods for various infectious diseases, including dengue and chikungunya.
