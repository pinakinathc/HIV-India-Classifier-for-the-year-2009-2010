: Members of Rotaract Club of Parvathy College of Arts and Science, who joined hands with all Rotary Clubs here, met aged people and children living with HIV in homes and orphans and beggars on streets personally and handed over the new dress, including dhoti, saris and towel, and sweets to them. Led by the Rotaract club president N. Geethanjali, a group of students walked on Madurai, Tiruchi and Palani highroads and identified beggars and orphans whose home was just platforms. Every orphan they met on the street corner or under an overbridge received a sweet box, a set of dresses and a towel, irrespective of their condition. The team did not forget to visit homes for orphaned children and the aged to comfort them. They greeted every inmate in the home and offered not only crackers and sweets but also shared their love and affection. In turn, they received blessings of unknown elders who were abandoned by the relatives.
