Staff Reporter NALGONDA: A team of higher officials from the health and other allied government agencies on Monday conducted an inquiry into the alleged refusal of admission to a HIV positive woman into the government area hospital and some private hospitals in Suryapet on Sunday evening. She delivered a baby girl by the roadside following the denial. According to sources, a team of revenue officials headed by the Suryapet RDO Manohar Gupta visited Kesaram village in the mandal and enquired about the incident with the 28-year-old HIV positive woman. Her relatives reportedly told the officials that she gave birth to a baby by the roadside after making futile attempts to get admission into the government area hospital as well as some other private hospitals which they alleged refused entry on knowing the HIV status of the woman. When contacted, the RDO Manohar Gupta told The Hindu that a detailed enquiry report has been submitted to the authorities for further action. Meanwhile, the woman and her new born baby have been admitted to the government area hospital in Suryapet for proper medical care.
