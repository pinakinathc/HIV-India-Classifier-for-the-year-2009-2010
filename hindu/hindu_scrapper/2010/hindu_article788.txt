Students of St. Joseph's college are determined to make a difference in the AIDS awareness movement. Immortalising the Gandhian philosophy of “Human beings live for others”, the Josephite AIDS Awareness Movement (JAAM) is trying to leave a mark. JAAM is a student body that aims to remove the stigma and banish the myths associated with HIV/AIDS. With only 10 students crowding its ranks initially, JAAM took birth under the leadership of late Barbara Naidu in 1994. Today, it has over 70 registered members, and several thousand unofficially. Ever since its inception, it has been an integral part of the college and is positioned as a proactive group championing a cause towards an AIDS-free world. Third-year students Nikita Nahar and Ruchi Kumar, explained: “We hold presentations in our classes, in schools, in our backyards and parks, trying hard to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. We invite renowned doctors and scientists for seminars and colloquiums to talk to us about the disease.” Besides, JAAM has been trying to educate public to overcome prejudices and baseless myths, and to accept the less fortunate ones. “We don't sympathise, we empathise,” they said. Members also visit HIV homes such as the Infant Jesus Home for HIV+ Children, and spend time with the residents, several of whom have been disowned by their own families. Recounting her experience of visiting an AIDS home in Somanahalli, Ms. Kumar said: “It was invaluable. They would not allow us to leave, we played, danced and sang. JAAM might be a small group, but we have already touched the lives of hundreds.” Last year, JAAM invited over 70 HIV-positive children and entertained them for at least two hours. JAAM also organises events such as the “Back for life” walk where more than a hundred students literally walked backwards on the roads of Bangalore, urging public not to turn their backs on the HIV patients. It also sold ribbons, the proceeds of which went to the AIDS homes.
