A photo exhibition, Life - A Celebration: an Exhibition of Photographs by + People, showcasing pictures taken by people living with HIV/AIDS will be held at the Alliance Francaise from December 11 to 14. The photographers are people living with HIV, trained by the Communication for Development and Learning in writing and photography skills to provide them with a means to express themselves. This show will be different from general photography exhibitions as the works may not be technically perfect. However, what the images will convey is the perspective of the photographers who live a tough life, having to battle social stigma and health problems. They will be present at the venue to explain the concept and idea behind their works. The initiative is supported by UNICEF and aims at providing confidence and skills for people living with HIV so they can be their own spokespersons. Communication for Development and Learning has instituted HIV/AIDS Journalism Awards in 2007 for those writing on HIV-related issues in the Kannada media. They will be given to two journalists on the inaugural day.
