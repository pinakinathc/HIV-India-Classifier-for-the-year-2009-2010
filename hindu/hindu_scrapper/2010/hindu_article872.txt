A talk on creating awareness among students on important issues such as leucoderma, HIV/AIDS and the problem of manual scavenging was held at the Madras Christian College on July 31.  Organised by the National Service Scheme unit of the college, it was attended by students and faculty members from all departments. K. Umapathy, founder, Leucoderma Awareness Movement of India, interacted with first year NSS volunteers. During his talk, he pointed out that leucoderma was only a skin condition and not a disease and that it could affect anyone mainly as it was caused due to a vitamin deficiency.  He regretted that even today, it was being referred to as “venkushtam” in Tamil Nadu and that it was important for the student community to volunteer and fight against the stigma associated with Leucoderma. Mr. Umapathy also distributed pamphlets to the students. Dhanaraj, founder of Tambaram Community Development Society spoke on HIV/AIDS. Samuel, State coordinator for Safai Karmachari Andolan spoke about how prevalent the practice of manual scavenging was despite the ban and court rulings on it. Yagna Sekar, NSS Programme Officer of the college welcomed the gathering. K. MANIKANDAN
