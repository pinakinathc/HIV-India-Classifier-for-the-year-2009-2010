The All-India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) has proposed a scheme to run educational institutions through democratically chosen councils as a means to check the indiscriminate privatisation of the education sector. Speaking to presspersons here on Thursday, AIDSO State president Rajashekhar V.N. said this system had worked effectively in West Bengal and could be extended to all other States. Government funding Under this system, the Government would fund educational institutes and universities, but stay away from their daily affairs. Councils consisting of educationists, students, parents and other stakeholders would take up the running of the institutes, Mr. Rajashekhar said. However, the Government would monitor the functioning of the institutes, he added. Mr. Rajashekhar took exception to the Government's move to promote privatisation of the education sector by allowing foreign universities to open shops here. This would turn education into a commodity and only a few people could afford it, he said. Besides, the focus on professional education would undermine science and social science education. The Government maintained that professional courses ensured more employment opportunities, but the economic slowdown had exposed this myth as thousands had lost jobs both at home and abroad, despite having higher professional qualifications, he said. “Our society may not produce a C.V. Raman or Rabindranath Tagore if real education is ignored totally,” he added. At present, 90 per cent of the money earmarked for education goes towards salaries. Hence, the Union Government should earmark a minimum of 10 per cent of the Union Budget towards education. The State governments should enhance budgetary allocation to the sector from 15 per cent to 35 per cent. Instead of providing tax benefits to information technology and biotechnology companies, the Government should use taxes from them to improve the education sector, Mr. Rajashekhar said.
