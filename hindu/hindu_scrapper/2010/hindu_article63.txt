Of the total number of pregnancies reported in the district, blood smear test was done in 87 per cent cases. Mr. Palanisamy called upon the medical fraternity to make sure that all pregnant women were covered under the scheme. Mr. Palanisamy further said that to prevent HIV infection, Nevirapine tablets were being administered to pregnant women and Nevirapine drops to newborns. All 108 ambulances should also stock the drug, both tablets and drops, in adequate quantity, the Collector said. He directed the Health Department to ensure that adequate number of blood test kits and protective kits for those who were attending to delivery should be kept in the Government Hospitals and the PHCs. He exhorted non-governmental organisations to work alongside the Government Hospitals to get help to the HIV affected. Joint Director of Health Services M. Dharamalingam and deputy directors (health) K.Krishnaraj and M.Geetha were present.
