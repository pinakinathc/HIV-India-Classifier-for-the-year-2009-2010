Special Correspondent MYSORE: The All-India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO), Mysore unit, on Thursday registered its opposition to the Foreign Education Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operation) Bill, 2010, the National Council for Higher Education and Research Bill and the Private Universities Bill. Activists of AIDSO staged a demonstration here and urged the Government to reject the three Bills which they described as “anti-education”. The activists took out a procession from K.R. Circle to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner and raised slogans against the Bills. AIDSO district unit vice-president G.S. Seema, who addressed the activists, said the introduction of the Private Universities Bill and the Foreign Education Bill would lend a lethal blow to the education system of the country. Education was increasingly being commercialised and unaffordable to the middle-class and economically backward sections of society. She said the education system was increasingly becoming market-oriented, devoid of ethics and morality and the universities had become commercial factories. Unit president B. Ravi said allowing foreign universities to function in the country would not help resolve the problems in the education system.
