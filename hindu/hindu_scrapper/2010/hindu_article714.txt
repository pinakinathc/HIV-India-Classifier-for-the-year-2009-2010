Over 20 African First Ladies will convene in the Uganda capital Kampala on Saturday for the African Union (AU) summit to discuss strategies of combating HIV/ AIDS on the continent, an official said here on Monday. The meeting of the Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS will be held from July 24 to 27 on the sidelines of the AU summit, which kicked off here on Monday amidst tight security, said Patrick Guma, spokesperson of Uganda's Foreign Ministry. “African First Ladies usually meet on the sidelines of AU summit to discuss the issues they agree on. In the last summit, they agreed on HIV/AIDS as theme of their meeting,” Mr Guma told Xinhua. “They will focus on how to address women's issues as well,” he said.
