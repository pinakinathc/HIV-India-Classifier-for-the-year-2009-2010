Minor irrigation and district in-charge Minister Govind Karjol has said Bagalkot is a model district in the country as far as targeted interventions among high risk groups of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are concerned but the number of HIV positive people in the district is quite high. Mr. Karjol was speaking at a media consultation programme organised by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) at the Deputy Commissioner's office here on Saturday. He said that every individual should get HIV tests done so that its spread can be stopped. KSAPS CEO Prakash said an integrated mass awareness campaign will be launched in Mudhol and Jamkhandi taluks of Bagalkot district on July 19. Film artistes Pooja Gandhi, Upendra and cricketers Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble will participate in the campaign. â€œA door-to-door campaign will be launched on July 19 at Mudhol. And, a three-month media event is expected to reach out to 90 per cent of the adult population in Mudhol and Jamakhandi taluks. The focus will be on migrant workers, farm labourers, youth, women from Self-Help Groups (SHGs), college students and gram panchayat members, he said. KSAPS Joint Director Rudrappa said the programme is aimed at spreading information on primary services available in the taluk to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS. The door-to-door campaign will cover 57,759 houses in Mudhol and 84,945 houses in Jamkhandi taluk by ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists), anganwadi workers, Link Workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs). So, in all 781 volunteers will visit 40 houses a day for six days, he added.
