Staff Reporter SANGAREDDY: District Medical and Health Officer Dr. M. Govardhan Reddy said that tuberculosis can be cured with effective use of drugs and patients need not worry about cost of the medicines as they would be supplied free of cost. Talking to media persons here on Monday, Mr. Reddy said that as many as 126 cases were identified in the district since October 2008 in Medak district. Out of them, 19 patients died due to various reasons while the remaining are being treated in Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) Plus category. More than 30 patients are being supplied drugs worth Rs. 2 lakh for the treatment. Mr. Reddy said that patients suffering with HIV/AIDS are being asked to undergo TB tests as they are more prone to it. As part of creating awareness among the public over TB, a rally would be held in Sangareddy on Tuesday. People were urged to send patients suffering with the disease to hospitals as each patient has a potential of harming 12 to 15 persons.
