The rally was organised to create awareness among people on HIV/AIDS and the newly-established Tamil Nadu Trust for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS. Collector T. Soundiah flagged off the rally at the Collectorate premises in the presence of Deputy Director of Health Raghunathan, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit Project Manager K. Sivamurugan and senior officials. Participants of the rally would sensitise people, particularly those in the rural areas, to AIDS prevention and control measures.

The rally, which began at Coimbatore, covered Tirupur and arrived in Erode on Sunday. It would pass through Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Thiruthani and Thiruvallur before reaching Chennai on World AIDS Day (December 1).

Currently, the trust caters to the educational, nutritional and other special needs of over 1,500 children across the State. Officials said that a total of 1,467 persons living with HIV/AIDS were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Among them, 25 were children.
