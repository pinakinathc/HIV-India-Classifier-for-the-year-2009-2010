The three-day ‘Illavattam – Youth Carnival 2010,' an HIV/AIDS awareness event, got off to a colourful start here on Tuesday. Nearly 1.5 lakh students from various schools and colleges across the State are participating in cultural and sports events, organised by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS). Inaugurating the event, Health Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam said that the youth were more susceptible to HIV/AIDS and awareness campaigns are necessary. Over 500 Red Ribbon Clubs would be set up in schools and colleges across the State. Of the 1.82 lakh people with HIV/AIDS in the State, nearly 45,000 are under ART treatment. “The ‘Varumun Kappom' scheme has integrated counselling in medical camps to sensitise people,” he said.
