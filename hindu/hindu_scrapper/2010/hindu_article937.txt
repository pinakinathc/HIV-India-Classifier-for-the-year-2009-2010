Murali Kumar    Reiterating the promises earlier made by Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa on introducing measures to improve the plight of the transgender community, the former Minister Shobha Karandlaje said that a welfare board would soon be set up for the community on the lines of the one in Tamil Nadu. She was speaking at a daylong conference on “The Millennium Development Goals and Transgenders” here on Wednesday, and stressed the need to introduce special health schemes for the community. The conference was organised to speak on a range of issues related to the community, besides the official focus on HIV prevention. Elavarthy Manohar of Sangama said that there was discrimination even in HIV care, with the focus on preventing its spread from the community to outside, rather than helping the affected in the transgender community. The former Chairperson of the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission, C.S. Dwarakanath, said that the final report he had submitted to the Government last month had specifically recommended reservation for the transgender community. He urged the activists to focus on implementing this recommendation.
