 The joint intervention programme of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) and the OISCA International- Kozhikode Chapter among the Injecting Drug Users (IDU) in the rural areas of district has entered its third phase. The three-year programme has covered 974 drug addicts so far. The project aims at reaching out to 1,134 IDUs who were identified through a field survey. By focussing on the IDUs, the organisers hope that they can largely prevent the scope of spreading the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). At present, the Suraksha-IDU scheme is covering 974 IDUs in the district. To stop the chances of reusing and exchanging of syringes, the outreach workers of the scheme are supplying fresh syringes and trying to make the IDUs withdraw from the habit slowly. According to project manager Jijo Varghese, the IDUs have been divided into different categories based on the frequency of using injecting drugs. “Presently, we are mainly focussing on two groups, the regular and the weekly users, to proceed with the intervention programme,” he said. The team has succeeded in finding out peer educators from the group of IDUs and to make use of their support in motivating the companions to give up the habit. The field activities are now being coordinated with the help of six outreach workers and they are taking care of five hotspots each, where the drug users gather for drug exchange. According to Mr. Varghese, there are 30 such identified hotspots in the rural areas of Kozhikode. Majority of them are located in Thamarassery, Koduvally, Koyilandy and Vadakara regions. Railway stations and bus stands in Vadakara and Koyilandy have more concentrations of the drug users, he pointed out. For the final phase of the project, the KSACS has sanctioned Rs.25 lakh. Altogether, 37 staff members are part of the intervention programme, which exclusively targets the IDUs.
