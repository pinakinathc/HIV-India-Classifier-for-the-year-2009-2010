Take care:Students taking out an awareness rally to mark the World Tuberculosis Day in Erode on Wednesday. Â   Staff Reporter ERODE: A large number of students and volunteers from various organisations took out a rally here on Wednesday to mark the World Tuberculosis Day. Flagged off by Joint Director of Health Dr. P. Nagarajan at the Government Hospital, the rally passed through important thoroughfares in the town before culminating at the IMA hall. Students raised slogans urging people to approach the nearby government health centres immediately, if they had symptoms of tuberculosis. Free treatment The government provided free treatment to the TB infected under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control programme. Later, at a seminar, speakers said that tuberculosis was contagious and spread through air. If not treated properly, each person with active tuberculosis would infect on an average 10 to 15 persons every year. Over 2 billion people in the world were infected with TB. India had over 180 lakh people suffering from TB. Of them, 80 lakh people were having active TB. The speakers said that people who were HIV-positive and infected with TB were 20 to 40 times more likely to develop active TB than people not infected with HIV. The district, which had a population of over 21 lakh, had 27 sputum testing centres, five sub district level TB units and dispensaries. In the last 10 months, over 26,000 persons were tested and 2,464 TB cases were identified in the district. Over 52 per cent of the persons infected with TB were identified and given treatment in the government hospitals and primary health centres. Officials appealed to the private hospitals in the district to report the TB cases to the district level TB control society on a monthly basis without fail. Senior officials participated in the meeting.
