The former South African President, Nelson Mandela, cancelled an appearance at the soccer World Cup opening ceremony on Friday after the death of his great grand-daughter, Zenani Mandela. But his message was displayed on the screens in the stadium: “The generosity of the human spirit can overcome all adversity. Through compassion and caring, we create ... hope.” The global stature of the 91-year-old Mr. Mandela, who led the country out of apartheid in 1994, helped the country win the right to host the World Cup. Zenani, 13, was killed in a car crash on her way back from a concert on the eve of the tournament. Police said the accident was caused by a drunken driver. Mr. Mandela's image appeared on screens to a message of hope from him in song. “The generosity of the human spirit can overcome all adversity. Through compassion and caring, we create ... hope.” Organisers had hoped that South Africa's first black President would wow the crowds with an appearance. “We are sure that South Africans and people all over the world will stand in solidarity with Mr. Mandela and his family in the aftermath of this tragedy,” said his foundation. Zenani's death is the latest tragedy to hit the Nobel laureate. One of his sons died of AIDS while another was killed in a car crash during Mr. Mandela's 27 years in jail as a prisoner of the apartheid regime. “The nation shares your loss and mourns with you, especially on the day on which our dreams and hopes come alive,” said South African President Jacob Zuma. In a letter to Mr. Mandela, FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he had been stunned “to hear the unspeakably tragic news.” Both men were present at the opening ceremony, alongside 78-year-old Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu. — Reuters, AFP
