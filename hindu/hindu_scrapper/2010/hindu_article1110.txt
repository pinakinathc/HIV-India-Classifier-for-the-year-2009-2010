The health authorities on Friday informed that very soon HIV testing facilities will be provided to pregnant women frequenting Urban Health Posts (UHP) in twin cities. In this connection, special centres for HIV testing will be set up at 15 of the 64 UHPs, where pregnant women visit in large numbers. Persons testing positive for HIV will be referred directly to the special counselling and HIV testing centres and an exclusive drive to make pregnant women aware of HIV in slums through Aanganwadi workers will be taken up. In a review meeting on HIV on Friday, Hyderabad District Collector, N. Gulzar directed authorities to make sure that all pregnant women within a UHP in the slums are tested for HIV. The authorities have also decided to upgrade the facilities available at the 28 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for HIV in the Capital. The HIV positive patients, from now on, will be referred to TB counselling, testing and treatment centres and awareness drives will be taken up in urban slums to encourage public to take up voluntary HIV testing. Efforts will also be made to provide nutritious food, free diagnostic facilities and pensions to HIV positive patients at various slums in twin cities, district health authorities informed. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) official, Dr. Rajan and other top district health authorities were present in the review meeting.
