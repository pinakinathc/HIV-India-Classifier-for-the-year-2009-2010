Staff Reporter DHARMAPURI: All HIV-infected persons are not AIDS patients, hence, they should be considered HIV patients. The appeal was made at the Media Consultation Programme conducted on HIV/AIDS organised by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) here on Tuesday. Dr. Jegannathan, Joint Director, Health Services, said the prevention, care and support services in the district for the HIV/AIDS affected persons would be scaled up soon. The clinic for the Sexually Transmitted Diseases STD would be established at Pappireddipatti and Periyamapatti primary health centres (PHCs).
