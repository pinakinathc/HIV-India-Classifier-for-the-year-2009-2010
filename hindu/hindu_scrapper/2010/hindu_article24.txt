Staff Reporter Bangalore: A new community-health project has been launched at the Bangalore Baptist Hospital to tackle the rising instances of cardiac disease in the country. The programme, which looks at prevention and management of cardiovascular disease, will be part of the hospital’s community health department which works in areas of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and alcoholism. The World Health Organisation has estimated that 60 per cent of the world’s cardiac patients would be in India by 2020, said Gift Norman, a doctor with Baptist Hospital. He was speaking at the 37th anniversary celebrations of the hospital where several new initiatives were inaugurated on Saturday. These include an “x-press clinic” that will be set up in Anand Nagar for the poor people. A new blood component laboratory and a blood bank had been set up here and can be availed by patients with Baptist Hospital as well as those from outside. Neena John, doctor with the hospital said that most countries around the world were choosing “component” transfusions (i.e. of red cells, platelets or plasma) over “whole blood” transfusions for several pragmatic reasons. One of the reasons was the increased shelf-life of the products when they were separated, she said. For instance, while red cells were used for replacement of traumatic or surgical blood loss, platelets were used during haemorrhages as they promote clotting. A 24-hour pharmacy and medical supplies central stock facility, by the main Bellary Road, will be accessible to all patients. Director of Baptist Hospital Alexander Thomas; Minister for Haj, Wakf and Minority Welfare Mumtaz Ali Khan and Member of Parliament D.B. Chandre Gowda spoke.
