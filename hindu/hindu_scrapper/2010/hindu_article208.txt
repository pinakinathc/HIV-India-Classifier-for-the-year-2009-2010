Special Correspondent JAIPUR: The Health Advisory Board of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (US) is on a visit to India from February 18 to 24 touring research sites and meeting scientific collaborators in the region. The Board members are using this as an opportunity for gaining first-hand information on important research projects and experiencing Indian culture. The delegation, touring Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, will visit the Indian Institute of Health Management Research here --an institution focused on improving public health and health care systems management through research, training and consultation. Ashok Agarwal, a trustee of IIHMR who helped found the institute in 1984, is hosting the Board’s visit to India. The visitors will also learn about India-based projects managed by Bloomberg School’s Centre for Communication Programs (CCP). CCP manages six programs in India addressing HIV/AIDS, family planning and reproductive health, water and health, and knowledge management. Through a USAID-funded grant, CCP leads the development of a national communication strategy to address HIV prevention, care and treatment. Most recently, CCP developed a popular music video featuring singing icon Shaan to promote responsible sexual (MORE) behaviour and HIV awareness among youth. CCP also works with the Bloomberg School’s Centre for Water and Health to provide safe water systems across the country.
