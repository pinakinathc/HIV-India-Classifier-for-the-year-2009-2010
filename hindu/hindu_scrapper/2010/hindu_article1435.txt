The World Health Organisation has endorsed a new and novel rapid test for tuberculosis which is especially relevant in countries most affected by the disease. The test could revolutionise TB care and control by providing an accurate diagnosis for many patients in about 100 minutes, compared to current tests that can take up to three months to have results. “This new test represents a major milestone for global TB diagnosis and care. It also represents new hope for millions of people who are at the highest risk of TB and drug-resistant disease,” said WHO Stop TB Department director Dr. Mario Raviglione. WHO's endorsement of the rapid test, a fully automated nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), follows 18 months of rigorous assessment of its field effectiveness in the early diagnosis of TB as well as multidrug-resistant TB and TB complicated by HIV infection, which are more difficult to diagnose.
