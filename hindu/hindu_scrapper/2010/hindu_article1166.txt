The Australian Sports Outreach Programme that seeks to use sports as a medium to promote education and other development goals at the grassroots level in the country has been launched by Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib here. An Australian Government initiative, the programme will be implemented by the Australian Sports Commission and involve a 5 million dollars commitment over five years. It is aimed at contributing to India's national development priorities targeting disadvantaged community groups and differently-abled persons. Speaking at the launch of the programme at the Australian High Commission, Senator Arbib said it would use sports to promote education and other development goals while fostering both sporting and life skills among marginalised children and youngsters. To operate in six locations, the programme will address development issues including primary school sport and physical education, disability sports, netball for empowerment of adolescent girls and prevention of HIV/AIDS and holistic child development through grassroots junior football and coach mentoring. Teaching swimming and life-saving for personal safety and youth livelihoods and income generation through sport will also be covered under the programme. Australian sports organisations will partner Indian agencies to ensure provision of technical advice and support.
