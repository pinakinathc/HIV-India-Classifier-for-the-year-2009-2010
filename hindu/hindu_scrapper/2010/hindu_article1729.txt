The government has sanctioned a sum of Rs.1,76,00,000 for providing free bus passes to persons living with HIV/AIDS for travelling to government hospital four times a month for treatment and check-up. According to a government release, 48,300 persons are likely to benefit. The scheme is only available for persons who are now getting free anti-retro viral drugs from the government. They are required to go to the nearest ART centre to pursue treatment at least twice every month. However, some of the poor people who are not able to fund this travel stop going to the centre and give up treatment too. It is to ensure that they do not discontinue treatment that the government has decided to provide free bus passes.
