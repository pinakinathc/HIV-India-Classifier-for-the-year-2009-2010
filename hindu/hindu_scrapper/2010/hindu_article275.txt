Special Correspondent Bangalore: Underscoring the importance of taking care of the health of drivers, especially those engaged in plying goods transport vehicles, State Joint Commissioner of Transport Vincent D'Souza said studies conducted on road accidents prove that nearly 20 per cent of road accidents were due to health-related problems of drivers. Inaugurating a five-day community convention programme organised by the Karnataka Goods Transporters' Association (KGTA)-Seva, funded by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAP) at the State-owned D. Devaraj Urs Truck Terminal Ltd. at Yeshwanthpur in the city on Monday, he said most of the road accidents were owing to sleepiness, tiredness and other health-related problems of drivers, which could easily be prevented with sufficient care. Appreciating the initiative taken by the KGTA-Seva and KSAP to educate the truck drivers, cleaners, helpers and other workers about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and also in arranging periodic health check-ups, Mr. D'Souza said the State Transport Department was encouraging such efforts. Regular blood check-ups, eye-camps and detection of diabetes were necessary, he said. KGTA-Seva Director V.R. Fernandes, who presided over the function, said the truck transport industry was the country's backbone as the drivers ply goods and equipment from place to place all over the country often spending weeks or months away from their homes. Apart from regular health hazards, the driving community was susceptible to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, he said.
