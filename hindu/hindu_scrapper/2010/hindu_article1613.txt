The community based organisations should come forward to extend a helping hand to the HIV-affected children in different parts of the district, said Collector Rajendra Ratnoo. Presiding over â€˜Santhippom and Sathippom-2011' programme organised by Centre for Social Reconstruction, a non-governmental organisation, based in Nagercoil here on Wednesday, the Collector said that the community-based organisations should come forward to extend help to the HIV-affected persons. The district administration would reach out to the HIV-affected persons particularly in the rural areas in cooperation with the department of health. He also said that community based organisations would be set up in all the four taluks including Kalkulam, Vilavancode, Thovalai and Agastheeswaram to help the affected persons. The director of CSR, T.S.Ramkumar, said that various non governmental organisations were involved in creating awareness in order to ensure the welfare and rights of the children affected with HIV. The early identification of such affected persons by the department of health has come as a boon to the people in the district.
