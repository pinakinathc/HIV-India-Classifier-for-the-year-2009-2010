Minister for Youth Services and Textiles Gulihatti D Shekhar on Friday said that a 12-point programme, including adoption of flood-hit villages in north Karnataka, has been planned under the National Service Scheme (NSS) in the State in 2010-11. The Minister chaired a meeting with officials of the department and NSS coordinators of all districts and said adoption of villages was a meaningful programme in the NSS. NSS volunteers would take up development works in flood-hit districts of north Karnataka and adopt some villages. Several villages had been adversely affected by last year's floods. NSS volunteers would construct toilets, playgrounds, community halls, promote rainwater harvesting, and carry out other works in villages and slums in north Karnataka villages and other parts of the State. About 1,001 blood donation camps, a marathon and sapling plantation programme would be organised, he said. It was proposed to construct a compound wall of the 250 acre campus of Karnataka Women's University. NSS volunteers would also conduct awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS, pulse polio, and protection of monuments.
