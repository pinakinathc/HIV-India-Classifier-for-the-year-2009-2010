HIV-affected people and those working with sexuality minorities and sex workers are up in arms. Two non-governmental organisations — Sadhana and Suraksha — forced their staff members to undergo HIV tests. Veena, community member and human rights activist, said that for more than three months, the staff members of the two NGOs were fighting against the forced HIV test. She said that it was ironic that the organisations which were supposed to work for the benefit of the HIV-infected community had forced staff members to undergo the test. This, she claimed, was in violation of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) guidelines and the Labour Act. She said that not only did the NGOs force the staff to get themselves tested, the members were forced to submit reports to Executive Director Maggie Thomas. After the staffers raised the issue in August, NACO directed the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) to look into the issue. On September 3, a KSAPS investigation team visited Ramanagaram and Channapatna and spoke to the staff and even took a declaration from them stating that they were forced to undergo HIV tests. The report was released on September 17. Manjesh, who used to work with Suraksha earlier, said that after being forced to submit their test reports, several employees faced enormous stigma and discrimination, and some even resigned. Karishma, Suraksha staff, said that the decision to force the staff was taken at a coordination committee meeting. The committee has 16 members, of whom 13 expressed objection to this decision. She also alleged that the KSAPS report glosses over the facts. Ms. Veena said that as per guidelines of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC), the report should be kept with the counsellor at the ICTC.
