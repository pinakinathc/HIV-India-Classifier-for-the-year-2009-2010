Tamilnadu AIDS Initiative (TAI) - Voluntary Health Services has launched a helpline for positive sex workers, providing them an opportunity to come to terms with the depression that grips them and continue living. The ‘Kelungal Tharappadum' hotline (22542301) helps the women who have been disowned by their family. Ironically, they are not cared for though the women financially support the family. TAI's project director Lakshmi Bai said 811 of the 1,770 sex workers identified in western Tamil Nadu's 12 districts were guilt-ridden. The underlying messages of the project are that anti-retroviral therapy should be taken regularly, nutrition is important and prevention methods such as safe sex should be adopted, Dr. Lakshmi said. “These women need psychosocial and emotional support. We help them to connect spiritually,” says Dr. Lakshmi Bai. Sometimes, she answers every call. “I probe them, record their speech and individually deal with their fear of death and emotional problems,” she said. “Within a week we provide financial help,” she added.
