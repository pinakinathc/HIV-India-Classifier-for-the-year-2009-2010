A group of HIV-infected persons requested the Collector C. Samayamoorthy to take steps to improve facilities at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre functioning on the District Headquarters Hospital premises. In a memorandum submitted during the grievances meeting on Monday, the HIV-infected persons pointed out to Mr. Samayamoorthy that the ART centre did not have separate rooms for councillors, doctors and waiting patients. “Owing to this, privacy that needed to be maintained in the counselling carried out for HIV-positive people is seriously affected,” R. Amritam, president of Tirupur Network for HIV-positive People, pointed out. She said that the ART centre in Tirupur, which was frequented by at least 60 persons a day, thus, required better care. A group of residents from R.V.E. Nagar and Kaliappa Nagar under Nallur municipality met the Collector on the day asking the district administration to stop the proposed move by a private organisation to construct a mosque in the locality. “Since the locality is a predominant caste-Hindu belt, it will be nice to refrain from construction of the mosque to avoid any possible religious frictions in the future,” they pointed out. According to them, already two mosques are there adjacent to these hamlets within an half a kilometre radius and hence, there is no need for a third one.
