Staff Reporter NEW DELHI: Non-government organisation “ Swechha: We For Change Foundation” had organised a petition handing over ceremony at Sanskriti School here appealing to politicians to direct efforts for achieving the Millennium Development Goals to end poverty by 2015. The petition, signed by over 500 students and youth activists as part of the Indian i-MDG community, was submitted to Member of Parliament Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Deo said: “It is of utmost importance to address issues of poverty, infant mortality, gender issues and HIV/AIDS. It is a problem which needs to be tackled soon… Let us first begin by talking to our parents of the MDGs. Let us try to create awareness in our own homes. If all of you get together, we as politicians, the Government as well as the entire civil society will stand up and listen.” UN Millennium Campaign National Campaign and Advocacy Specialist Mandira Moddie said the campaign supports citizens from around the world to take action and to hold their governments to account for the achievement of the MDGs. “We believe that an active citizenry is essential to ensure that we live in a world where everyone has access to good health, education and food. We believe that youth should be the drivers of change and make efforts to hold all relevant authorities accountable for their future,” she added. A documentary “The Green Billion” tracing the efforts of the Sanskriti School for the cause was screened on the occasion. Later, a short play on environmental sustainability was performed by a group of street children from non-government organisation Jamghat.
