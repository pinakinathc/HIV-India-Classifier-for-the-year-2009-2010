Speaking at a protest march organised here on Thursday, he accused the State Government of discriminating against the Dalits. “Problems like discrimination on the basis of caste in hotels, maths, increasing incidence of AIDS among   and low wages for daily workers exist but the Government is not doing anything to solve them,” he said. Accusing the Government of introducing policies which were against the interests of the Dalits, the protesters demanded the repealing of the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2010, as red meat formed the basic diet of the Dalits. K. Varadarajan, polit bureau member, said even after 60 years of Independence, everyone was not treated equally, especially in States like Karnataka. “In more than 50 villages in the State, social boycott or untouchability is practised and action has not been taken by the authorities. In today's India, democracy is decided by caste or money,” he added. The march, originally planned to end at the Chief Minister's residence, was cut short as Minister for Social Welfare Sudhakar Rao visited them at Freedom Park. The Minister was presented with a letter to the Chief Minister urging him to look into the living conditions of Dalits.
