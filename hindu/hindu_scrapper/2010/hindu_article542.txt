ADMHO P. Uma Devi launched the third phase of the Subham programme of the National AIDS Control Organisation and the A.P. State AIDS Control Society at the DMHO conference hall here on Thursday. Subham is an intensive campaign for improving the services in Government STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs). Under the programme, persons with sexually promiscuous behaviour and any other individual might undergo testing in the STI clinics and ICTCs and take necessary steps to protect themselves from the scourge of HIV/AIDS. Subham-III will be held in all 57 mandals up to July 10, 2010. District AIDS Control Programme Officer L. Madhusudana Rao said 70 per cent of high-risk individuals were tested under the first two phases of Subham and 307 more remain to be tested in the third phase.
