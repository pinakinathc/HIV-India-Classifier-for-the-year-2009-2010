Staff Reporter VISAKHAPATNAM: Noted gastroenterologist E. Peda Veeraraju has said there are many myths and misconceptions about Hepatitis B even among educated people and there is an urgent need to spread awareness to clear doubts. In a statement on the eve of World Hepatitis Day, observed every year on May 19 to create awareness on Hepatitis, he said there is a misconception that it is a killer virus and more dangerous than AIDS. “This is not true. Though both of them may get transmitted through blood or body fluid, containing blood and Hepatitis B is more readily transmitted than HIV, the similarity ends there,” he stated. According to Dr. Veeraraju, a small fraction with acute Hepatitis will develop chronic liver disease, which can be treated with medicines. Another misconception is that Hepatitis B infection will always end up in liver cancer. Though a small minority may develop this problem, he said, majority of chronic Hepatitis carriers may remain healthy throughout their lifetime and need not worry about this possibility all the time. It is estimated that there are 400 million Hepatitis B carriers in the world today and 75 per cent of them hail from Asia. The doctor said they should consult an expert once in six months with liver-function tests and if required should undergo ultrasound test to detect `flares' and get treated if chronic liver disease supervenes. He said cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women, patients with long-term steroid therapy and family members of Hepatitis carriers should undergo required tests. Stating that it could be prevented, he said vaccines were available in the market. All children should receive their first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine, second dose after one month and third after six months.
