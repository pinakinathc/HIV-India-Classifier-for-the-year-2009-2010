Staff Reporter ELURU: The `Red Ribbon Express', which was flagged off on April 4 as part of launching a campaign-on-wheels against AIDS, will roll into Bhimavaram on April 24. The eight-bogie express with exhibition stalls showcasing the exhibits depicting human anatomy and a conference hall for conducting training programmes for key resource persons engaged in the anti-AIDS campaign, will be kept at the railway junction at Bhimavaram for two days, facilitating a public awareness campaign against AIDS. An ICTC van with the required equipment will be kept on a railway platform for undertaking AIDS/HIV screening tests during the two days, according to Raja Prasanna Kumar, Associate Project Director, Andhra Pradesh AIDS Control Society. The express is scheduled to go round 10 districts, covering 11 railway stations with a mission against AIDS. Kala jathas were pressed into service in and around the Bhimavaram town for propagation of the arrival of express through the medium of folk arts. Dr. Jagadish, District AIDS Control Officer, asserted that the incidence of HIV/AIDS was brought down by 1 per cent in the district as a result of the campaign. Speaking at a meeting, Collector A. Vani Prasad took serious note of the alleged denial of treatment to the HIV/AIDS victims in government hospitals across the district. Ms. Prasad said she had received complaints that a section of personnel in the government hospitals were refusing to attend delivery cases involving the HIV/AIDS infected women. She asked S. Nagarjuna, District Coordinator, Health Services, to take punitive action against such personnel.
