Collector T.N. Hariharan on Tuesday flagged off a HIV/AIDS awareness rally. The relay bicycle rally would reach Chennai after brief halts at Chathirakudi, Paramakudi, Seerathangudi, Satharasankottai and other areas.

The focus of this year's message was that they should lead a life as equal to others. All rights should be ensured to them. No one should show discrimination towards the affected people. Similar rallies had also been started from Kanyakumari and Coimbatore. K. Balasubramaniam, District Revenue Officer, Thirumavalavan, Joint Director, H.
