T he Citizens Run Trust, launched to extend financial support to NGOs who work for the welfare of various destitute and disadvantaged children and adults, is into its 12th edition. To mobilise funds for this cause, the Citizens Run Trust organises a cross-city run every year; this also helps create awareness among citizens. The run covers a distance of approximately six km each year. This time around, it takes place on August 1 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., starting at Lady Willington College and concluding at Labour Statue. The funds are realised through the sale of T-shirts (Rs. 200 each) and donations from corporates. This time, Round Table India has joined hands with the Trust for the event. The run will be followed by an entertainment programme featuring Artseek Drum Circle and the John Britto's Dance Company. The beneficiaries of the Citizens Run 2010 are Selvi Memorial Illam Society, Tambaram, Vasantham Special School and Vanavil School.
