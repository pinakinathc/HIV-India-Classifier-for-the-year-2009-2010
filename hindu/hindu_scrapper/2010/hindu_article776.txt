At least 10,000 students from across the State are likely to participate in an open session to be held as part of the fifth State-level students' conference being organised by the All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) in Dharwad in September. Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, AIDSO State secretary Pramod and president of the reception committee K. Raghavendra Rao said that the major problems in the field of education, including new policies, would be discussed during the three-day conference from September 18. Dr. Pramod said that the open session would be held on September 18. He said dis-affliliation of colleges from universities and abolition of governing bodies such as Medical Council of India were aimed at further commercialisation of education. Mr. Raghavendra Rao said that successive governments had paved the way for commercialisation of education, and foreign participation was being allowed in the field. He said AIDSO was trying to raise awareness among students and the general public on these issues. The conference would further strengthen the students' movement in this regard, he added. Secretary of the reception committee Gangadhar Badiger said that several organisations had extended assistance to organise the State-level conference. An 80-member reception committee comprising eminent personalities had been constituted. A preliminary meeting of the committee was held on Tuesday, he added.
