Bordering backward pockets of Orissa that report large scale migration are witnessing gradual increase in population being affected by HIV. Researchers at the Orissa State AIDS Control Society were surprised to find the rise in detection of HIV Positive every month from these regions. OSACS sources said Nabarangpur was the biggest surprise for health administrators as this small backward region bordering to Chhattisgarh report 30 to 40 new HIV cases every month. Similarly, Koraput is another southern district where detection of HIV positive is going up. Monthly reports from past one year said about 30 new positive cases came to the light. Bolangir which is known for its large migration population too report increasing number of HIV positive cases. OSACS sources said district labour officers were asked to intercept small traders from Andhra Pradesh who came to Koraput to secure raw spices commodities. It was found that these small traders were invariably carrying condom packets which were indicative of their high sexual behaviour. Researchers say gullible people in the backward regions without having knowledge about HIV and AIDS were falling prey to the killer disease. Despite the emergence of new areas, Ganjam continued to remain the place having high concentrated population affected by HIV and AIDS. The district reports 70 to 80 new cases every month. According OSACS, about 19,188 people tested HIV cases in the State.
