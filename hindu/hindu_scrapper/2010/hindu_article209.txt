Special Correspondent HYDERABAD: TDP and Congress members in the Legislative Council almost came to blows on Friday when a question raised by the opposition about de-notification of IT SEZ lands for other purposes degenerated into an ugly wordy duel. The response of Information Technology Minister K.Venkata Reddy that TDP members were levelling allegations with jaundiced eyes, provoked Leader of Opposition Dadi Veerabhadra Rao to retort: “If we have jaundice, then the Minister has AIDS.” This remark led to bedlam in the House forcing Chairman A.Chakrapani to adjourn the Question Hour. It all started when M. Venkata Siva Reddy (TDP) raised alleged violations in IT SEZs by promoters in diverting land for real estate purposes. He sought to know whether the government had agreed to de-notify 115 acres of the 150-acre IT SEZ allotted to M/s Indu TechZone Pvt. Ltd in Mamidipally village in Ranga Reddy district. The IT Minister said the company had applied to Board of Approvals, Union Ministry of Commerce, for de-notification of 115 acres. The State had issued it a show-cause notice for non-utilisation of 115 acres and would take action on getting a response. However, when Mr.Veerabhadra Rao demanded a House Committee to expose misuse of land by IT SEZs, the Minister turned it down. He said the TDP government had given away 450 acres of prime land to IMG Bharata for a golf course at a throwaway price. Members calmed down when Municipal Administration Minister A. Ramnarayan Reddy said it was not proper for the opposition to insist on a House Committee when the Minister had promised action for any violation of norms. He also said the government would take back lands from other IT companies too if violations were proved.
