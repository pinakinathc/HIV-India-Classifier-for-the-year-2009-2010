As many as 15 HIV cases have been identified among the 1000 construction workers during the health checkup being conducted under ‘Arogya Sampada' scheme. The district administration feared that many more workers and others would become victims of the diseases if it was not controlled immediately. As part of the scheme, medical camps are organised to identify chronic diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, jaundice, HIV and AIDS. However, the district administration is conducting HIV tests discreetly as workers hesitate to attend the test fearing social boycott. District Rural Development Agency Administrative Officer V.Jagannatham Naidu said the DRDA was planning to create a labour bank by collecting details of all the labour so that their health history will also be available with the government.“Our aim is to create health awareness among the workers through the scheme. “This will enable them to identify the chronic diseases and get treatment in the initial stage,” he added. Indian Red Cross Society, District Medical and Health Department are also extending support to the camps. During the camps, blood group is also identified and same will be informed to the worker. It is observed that many injured workers could not get blood as many of them do not know about their group. With this scheme, a card will be issued immediately mentioning the blood group. The administration has decided to involve youth clubs and non governmental organisations in creating health awareness under Arogya Sampata scheme. The medical camps will be organised throughout the district in a phased manner.
