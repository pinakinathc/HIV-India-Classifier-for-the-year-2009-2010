A person admitted to the MKCG Medical College Hospital with HIV symptoms has alleged that he is being neglected during treatment. With the help of a social organisation, Manav Adhikar Surakhya Manch (MASM), he has approached the State Human Rights Commissioner and the Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC), southern division, for intervention so that he could get proper treatment. According to Abani Gaya of MASM the condition of the patient is critical. The HIV positive patient hails from Kashipur block in Rayagada district. He also suffers from leprosy. His HIV infection has added to the woes. The patient has alleged that he is not getting proper care and attention due to his HIV status. Although it is too hard for him to walk around, yet no wheel chair has been provided to him. Yet he is being directed by doctors to visit different sections of the hospital to get different tests done, he alleges. The HIV positive man has also alleged that his scheduled operation is being intentionally delayed. The Superintendent of the medical college during his interaction with the MASM activists has stated that the date for his operation will be fixed with the arrangement of proper amount of blood of A+ group needed by the patient. Regional coordinator of the Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS) Loknath Mishra has said they have also received information about the HIV positive patient admitted in the medical college hospital. “We are making all possible efforts so that he could get all possible medical help without any discrimination due to his HIV status,” he says.
