Staff Reporter SRIVILLIPUTTUR: A HIV-infected man was handed out seven years imprisonment for raping two minor girls. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, P. Murugambal, on Wednesday awarded a similar sentence to the sister of the accused for assisting him in the crime. According to the prosecution, the sister had facilitated the rape of the girls, then aged 12 and 15 years, to take revenge on her defeat in the local body elections. The girls, who often fell sick, later tested positive for HIV. The Vanniyampatti police had registered a case in April 2008. The man was charged with rape and attempt to murder. The court also imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 each on both.
