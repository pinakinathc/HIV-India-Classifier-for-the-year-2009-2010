Led by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) district unit leaders, the volunteers lay seize to the office for about an hour raising slogans demanding increased pay and better employment conditions. There were about 4,000 volunteers across the district in the AIDS awareness programme with a meagre pay of Rs. 40 per day. Addressing the gathering, K. Madhavi and others said the volunteers should be paid honorary wage of Rs. 100 per day. She said the low wages being paid to the volunteers were also pending for one year.
