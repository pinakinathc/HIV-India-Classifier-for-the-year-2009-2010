Concerned over the dismal ranking of Karur among the top 10 HIV-infected districts in the State, the district administration has got down to brass tacks and decided to step up awareness to arrest the spread of the virus, said Collector J.Uma Maheswari. The administration is implementing a slew of programmes such as adopting HIV affected children and offering them free education for a year and meeting the dietary requirements of HIV patients through the government hospital here, the Collector observed. Candles were lighted and people observed two-minute silence in memory of the infected, at an awareness programme organised on World AIDS Day, here on Wednesday. Ms. Maheswari pointed out that continuous counselling and treatment were being provided to the people living with HIV. Besides, the medicines were being offered free of cost at the ART Centre of the Government Hospital in Karur. The HIV affected people require our support and care, and the more we understand them the better it is for society, the Collector said. District Project Manager (AIDS) S.P.Raja; Joint Director (Health Services) Raju; Medical Superintendent of GH, Raghunath and AIDS Control Project Officer Pushpalatha spoke.
