Orissa AIDS Control Society (OSACS) on Wednesday launched an ambitious project in several districts of the State to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS among migrant workers. The project was launched in Ganjam, Khurda, Cuttack, Balasore, Sambalpur, Sundargarh and Bolangir districts. The awareness programme for migrant workers started with the help of the Ministry of Railway in Cuttack and other nine districts. Many dignitaries from East Coast Railway and OSACS were present on the occasion. Study has revealed that the number of HIV positive persons was higher in the districts, which have the maximum number of migrant labourers. Most of the people, who tested positive, had contracted the disease from their place of work.  According to an official release, about eight lakh people from rural areas of Orissa work in industries like textiles and diamond cutting in Surat and Ahmedabad respectively. Migrant workers were at high risk for HIV/AIDS and STD because of lack of AIDS education, illiteracy, economic impact and ignorance. Many migrant workers have little or no knowledge about basic health care or sex education. They have no medical care, and act as potential carriers for a number of infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS awareness, training and counselling programme was initiated by OSACS for persons involved in migration for wage by means of especially trained peer support, working on different categories of workers and ethnic groups.
