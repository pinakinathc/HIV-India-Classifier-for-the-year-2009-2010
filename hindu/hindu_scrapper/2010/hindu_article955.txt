Isha Foundation's Isha Community Care Centre conducted a support group meet for people living with HIV/AIDS and their family members at Palladam near here on Sunday. The programme was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Palladam, the Lions Club of Palladam, and the Rotary Club of Palladam Rainbow. The meet provided a common platform for the people with HIV/AIDS to share their personal grievances. About 500 people benefitted from it. They were introduced to yoga to reduce stress and enhance physical wellbeing. Health experts and people from different walks of the society interacted with the participants. Isha's Mobile Health Clinics refer the patients exhibiting HIV-related symptoms to the nearest Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres under a programme initiated by the Foundation for the care of people with HIV/AIDS.
