City-based HIV/AIDS physician Kutikuppala Surya Rao has mooted research-based science communication practices to familiarise people on various health problems. Dr. Rao, who presented a paper on ‘Medical science communication emerging challenges – a study' at the 11 {+t} {+h} international conference on public communication of science and technology at New Delhi earlier this week, said rise of a host of molecular and digital technologies for investigating and intervening with the body was still largely not available for practical application. Dr. Rao, who based his paper on the basis of feedback from a study conducted among 300 science students from various colleges, said a pre-tested questionnaire was given to all participants before an awareness session on HIV/AIDS – its cause, prevention and treatment. After the session, the participants were asked to fill the questionnaire. The awareness among various batches varied from 15 to 89 per cent. He said arts students, in spite of repeated counselling, did not show any interest to enrol in the medical communication study and to attend awareness session.
