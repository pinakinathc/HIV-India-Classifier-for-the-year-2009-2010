Balaganessin TIRUCHI: Hundreds of students of Vasavi Vidhyalaya in the city, accompanied by their parents and grandparents, embarked on a unique venture on Sunday for the cause of creating awareness on HIV/AIDS. The students and their parents assembled at the sprawling grounds of the school in the early hours of Sunday and started leaving the foot-print of their right legs on a large piece of canvas cloth. With their rights legs immersed in paint, the participants left the impression on the cloth. About 3,500 persons, including 600-odd students, participated in the event which is to be sent for entry in The Guinness Book of World Records. Every inch of the cloth, 24 metres long and 27 metres wide, was marked with the foot-print. The entire area of 648 square metres was conveniently divided into different slots, each slot having the foot-prints in a specific colour. In the middle of the cloth were a couple of slogans “3G (generations) promise to mitigate AIDS” and “Save future India” which were also marked by foot-prints all over. The event, which started at about 5 a.m., was completed five hours later. School secretary A. Madhava Manoharan said that this was yet another effort by the school to enter The Guinness for the second time. He appreciated the cooperation by the parents and grand-parents. A rally was taken out at the end of the event. A. Kaliyamoorthy, Superintendent of Police, Tiruchi, who offered felicitations, appealed to the parents and teachers to impart values to the students. K. Swaminathan, Chief Educational Officer; N. Jayakumar, Inspector of Matriculation Schools; and G.R. Kalki Varadarajulu, president of the school, were participated.
