The Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) will step up its efforts to increase awareness among people about the disease and sustain the reduction in prevalence of HIV/AIDS that has been achieved in recent times. At a press conference here on Monday, R. Chandravadan, Project Director, APSACS, said three months of analysing about 70 per cent of the 25,200 samples collected from across the State had shown that prevalence of the disease had come down from 1.22 per cent of the population last year, to 0.85 now. This was made possible due to efforts of the government and voluntary agencies in increasing awareness levels that would lead to the number of districts in the State with less than one per cent of HIV cases going up from eight in 2008, to 17 this year, he said. “We have been successful in slowing down its prevalence and wish to consolidate the gains by taking up awareness at the micro-level, up to the villages,” he said. APSACS proposes to scale up HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) sites from 72 last year to 94 this year. Also, the number of mobile Integrated Council and Testing Centres will be increased to 23 from 18 now, in a bid to reach out to the more villages, he said.
