The government decision comes in the wake of allegations that the Chiranjeevi Eye and Blood Bank, run by Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust, was selling blood collected from donors, though it was getting grants from government for screening of the blood. Noted film producer and Chiranjeevi’s brother-in-law Allu Aravind requested the State government to enquire into the matter following allegations levelled by actors Rajasekhar and Jeevitha that blood was being sold by the Chiranjeevi Eye and Blood Bank despite getting grants from the Cente. Chief Minister K Rosaiah on Monday directed the Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) to probe into the Chiranjeevi Eye and Blood Bank affairs and submit a report by September 20. Accordingly, APSACS R V Chandravadan constituted a six-member committee comprising officials of his own wing as well as the AP State Drugs Control Administration to enquire into the allegations. “As per government order, a team comprising officials of APSACS and Drug Controller has been constituted. We will go into the details on the functioning of the blood bank and also carry out the financial audit and probe allegations of misuse and others,” Mr. Chandravadan told PTI.
