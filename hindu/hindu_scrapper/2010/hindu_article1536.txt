Members of the Karnataka Sex Workers' Union and HIV/AIDS activists staged a snap protest at the programme organised by the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day here on Wednesday. The protesters, sporting black banners, black flags and red umbrellas (the international symbol for sex workers) raised slogans against the KSAPS and threw pamphlets in the air. Charging KSAPS with routinely violating human rights, they condemned what they called its “illegal and inhuman practices.” They demanded the suspension of the KSAPS Joint Director, stoppage of line-listing in targeted interventions, forced HIV testing and breaking confidentiality of people living with HIV. Manohar Elavarthi from Sangama charged that KSAPS forces all non-government organisations (NGOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs) implementing HIV prevention projects among sex workers and sexual minority communities to maintain a line list of all the people they are reaching out to. The line list contains a lot of personal information, which is often collected without the consent of the people concerned. “The information is taken by KSAPS, which violates the right to privacy and confidentiality. It exposes people to greater stigma and discrimination,” Mr. Manohar said.
