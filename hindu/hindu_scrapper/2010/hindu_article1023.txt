The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Union government to take four factors — cost, efficacy, side effects and incidence of the disease in India — into consideration before including any new vaccine in its Universal Immunisation Programme. The direction by a Division Bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Manmohan came on a public interest litigation by a former Union Health Secretary and other experts in the field. Earlier, counsel for the government submitted that it was testing the efficacy of the pentavalent vaccines — DPT, HIV and Hepatitis-B — in two States before implementing it in the whole country. The government further submitted that an expert committee had been set up to examine the recommendation of the Health Ministry's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation to introduce vaccines in the immunisation programme. The petitioners submitted that the vaccines on trial were earlier included in the universal immunisation programme without requisite studies by an independent body. They alleged that the vaccines which were of questionable utility, expensive and also carried possible side effects were introduced at the cost of public exchequer at the behest of World Health Organisation and vaccine manufacturers. The policy should prescribe mandatory analysis and epidemiological studies to be carried out before introduction of a vaccine in the public health system.
