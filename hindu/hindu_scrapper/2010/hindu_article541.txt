The group of children was all smiles. They were girls and boys drawn from different government-run schools listening in rapt attention to the speakers on the dais. This experience has been an encouraging one for them. The crowd of 650 children were all beneficiaries of an education scheme, the Vasavya Education and Knowledge Building Programme that has made it possible for them to continue their education. Funded by the Dutch Bank and implemented by Vasavya Mahila Mandali (VMM), a local NGO, the education programme aims at extending financial and moral support to orphans and vulnerable children hailing from households affected by HIV/AIDS. School uniforms and notebooks were distributed. Most of them excited to receive their ‘gifts' from the city Mayor M.V. Ratna Bindu. Jyothi, a Std. VIII girl, when asked to share her experience as a beneficiary of the educational programme, expressed her gratitude to the funding authorities and the scheme implementing agency. “Going to school would have been a distant dream for me but for the organisation that came forward to sponsor education for me and for my many other friends.” “The idea behind implementing the programme is to provide a new base of life for these under-privileged HIV-affected kids while building community capacity to prevent further infection of the dreaded virus. In order to reach out to the neediest section, we focussed on street children, child labourers, adolescent girls and orphans,” said G. Rashmi, general secretary of VMM. The programme also aims at reducing the economic burden on the families affected by HIV or AIDS, to provide psycho-social support to vulnerable children, to sensitise school teachers and to increase literacy among these children. Many of the young beneficiaries are HIV-infected children who managed this to fight stigma and discrimination and face the society with confidence. This speaks volumes about their inner strength.
