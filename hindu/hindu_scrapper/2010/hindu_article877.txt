Justice N. Ramamohana Rao of the A.P. High Court on Monday directed the government to continue the services of outreach workers involved in the prevention/spread of HIV/AIDS. He passed the interim order on a writ petition filed by Srinivas and seven others of Mahabubnagar district. The petitioners said they have been engaged as outreach staff to work on a monthly salary of Rs.3,000 each. They contended that they were HIV-affected persons and that they have been asked to go to rural areas. Recently, the government decided to discontinue their services. The judge expressed surprise and directed officers to continue them. A division bench of the court, comprising Chief Justice Nisar Mohamad Kakru and Justice Vilas Afzulpurkar, on Monday ordered issue of notices to the government and beneficiaries on a writ petition challenging regularisation of land in Ameerpet. The writ petition was filed by advocate P. Krishna Reddy, who said the government had issued GO 288 on July 15 regularising 9.14 acres. He lamented that the land to be used for public purposes was squandered in the name of regularisation.
