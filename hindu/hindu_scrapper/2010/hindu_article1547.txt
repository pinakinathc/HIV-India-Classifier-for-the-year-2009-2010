Contradicting the United Nations report on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for 2010, which says that the disease is on the decline among sex workers in Karnataka, statistics available locally indicate that the disease in that group is on the ascendance. Figures culled by the Karnataka AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) reveal that there has been an alarming jump in infection among high-risk groups such as sex workers. Surveillance figures provided by the KSAPS to   on the eve of World AIDS Day show that the prevalence rate among women in sex work, which fell from 14.4 per cent in 2003 to 5.3 per cent in 2007, saw an increase to 14.19 per cent in 2008. In 2009, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) did not conduct the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) in the entire country because of “logistical problems”. KSAPS Project Director R.R. Jannu said the surveillance could not be carried out as NACO took a decision against it. “HIV is not a disease whose prevalence can suddenly fall or increase. It does not make much difference if the survey is not done for one year,” he said. According to KSAPS figures, prevalence among people who visited clinics for sexually transmitted diseases fell from 13.39 per cent in 2003 to 7.15 per cent in 2007. But this increased to 10.97 per cent in 2008. Unlike in the neighbouring States, the prevalence among men having sex with men (MSM) in Karnataka has come down from 17.6 per cent in 2007 to 12.62 per cent in 2008. However, the prevalence among injected drug users (IDU) has remained at 2 per cent. Among women who visited the antenatal centres, the prevalence rate, which had come down from 1.98 in 2002 to 0.86 in 2007, rose to 0.89 in 2008. According to statistics, Bagalkot district has acquired the dubious distinction of having the third highest prevalence of HIV in the country after Kadapa and Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. With a prevalence rate of 2.2 per cent, Bagalkot stands first in the State for high HIV prevalence. The district, which had the privilege of starting the HIV programme as early as in 1998 as part of the Indo-Canadian HIV/AIDS Project (ICHAP), saw several programmes taken up by NACO, the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) and the KSAPS. “It is unfortunate to see the prevalence going up again in a district which received so much funding and services,” official sources said. However, the State is doing well in terms of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), which is a multi-drug regimen to contain the viral load. Saroja Puthran, president of the Karnataka Network for People Living with HIV, who has been living with HIV for 12 years without ART, said, “ART is not a cure. But it dramatically increases the health of a person and prolongs the lifespan. “With ART, people with HIV can even live for 15 to 20 years,” she said. In Karnataka, there are 50,485 people living on first-line ART therapy. Although the Government has started providing free second-line ART therapy, not more than 30 are able to get it.
