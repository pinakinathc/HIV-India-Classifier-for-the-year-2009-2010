A 200-room hostel for students of Coimbatore Medical College will be built soon, said P. Umanath, District Collector, at a meeting here on Tuesday. A modern blood bank would also be constructed, he said at the National Voluntary Blood Donation Day. It was part of the State Government's efforts to ensure that the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) delivered quality service to the patients. The Government would soon see to it that the hospital, which would complete 100 years, had all its needs fulfilled. Mr. Umanath gave away digital thermometers to the hospital administrators and said the staff would henceforth be able to accurately measure temperature, something that they had not been able to do with thermometers with mercury. He said the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) accorded high priority to the blood collected by carrying out tests for HIV, jaundice, STDs, malaria, etc. It ensured that every unit collected was safe and secure. He appreciated the trustees of Pollachi K. Angamuthu Mudaliar Trust and A. Ravichandran of Valparai for donating towards the construction of a room to house relatives of patients. Over 100 donors from Coimbatore and nearly 120 from Erode, the Nilgris and Tirupur participated. Coimbatore has 21 blood banks, including four government-run ones. Since January this year, the Coimbatore Government Blood Bank had collected 5,524 units of blood. Siva Subramaniam, Joint Director of Health Services, Senthil Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services, Mathivanan, Medical Superintendent, CMCH, Mohamed Ali, District Programme Manager, DaPCU, Mangayarkarasi, Blood Bank Medical Officer, and others participated.
