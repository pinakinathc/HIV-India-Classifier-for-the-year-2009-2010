Irula tribals attending a tuberculosis awareness programme at Kallampalayam on Thursday. Â   In keeping with the objective of the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme to expand its activities, the Nilgiris district TB Centre launched a programme at Kalampalayam near Thengumorahaada on Thursday to bring under its care beneficiaries of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). Pointing out that Kalampalayam in a remote part of the Nilgiris had been chosen because it had a sizeable tribal population and tribal groups are among the most vulnerable sections of society, the Deputy Director, Health Services (TB) P.J. Vasanthan said that as part of the launch Irula tribals employed in a NREGA scheme were familiarised with various aspects of TB and AIDS. Stating that normally in an area, one TB case would be detected every five years, he regretted that in Thengumorahaada area six cases had been detected within a short period and five of them were tribals. Attributing the alarming situation to mal-nutrition, poverty, illiteracy and lack of awareness, Dr. Vasanthan said that the design of the houses occupied by the tribals facilitated the spread of the malady. In about a fortnight a plan to involve private practitioners in battling the disease would be put in place. It would be followed by a joint effort by the health department and the Catholic Bishops Conference of India.
