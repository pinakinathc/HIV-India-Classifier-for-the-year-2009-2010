Special Correspondent VISAKHAPATNAM: The Opposition parties of Praja Rajyam and CPI(Marxist) criticised the State budget introduced by Chief Minister K. Rosaiah in the Assembly on Saturday describing it as a jugglery of figures. In a statement, PRP MLA from Anakapalle and its Deputy Floor Leader in the Assembly, Ganta Srinivasa Rao said though Mr. Rosaiah showed his ‘prowess’ in the budget, the latter would not be of any use to the common man. The allocations for rural development, agriculture, irrigation and power did not raise any hopes and it all looked like a jugglery of figures. Nor were adequate funds allocated for education and health, he said. He welcomed the sanction of pension to AIDS patients from this year. CPI(M) district secretary Ch. Narasinga Rao said the budget looked like bogus one. Mr. Rosaiah’s show was ostentatious at Rs.1.13 lakh crore budget. Though he introduced a Rs.1 lakh crore budget last year, it belied the r allocations with a shortfall of Rs.25,000 crores, he said.
