Kiran Kumar Reddy    Staff Reporter HYDERABAD: Assembly Speaker N. Kiran Kumar Reddy urged the legislators to make it a habit to speak on HIV/AIDS in every meeting they participate, irrespective of the occasion. This would make a lot of difference in creating awareness among people, he felt. Speaking at a meeting of the AP Legislators' Forum on HIV and AIDS here on Monday for sensitisation of MLCs and MLAs on the disease, Mr. Reddy said the legislators could highlight at least two-three aspects related to HIV/AIDS in every meeting as awareness was the best prevention. He further suggested the legislators to take a few questions from the audience, if possible, to create interest in the subject. 5 lakh patients Project Director of AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) R.V. Chandravadan said the State had one-fifth (about 5 lakh) of the country's AIDS patients and the rate of incidence was one per cent. As the number of traditional sex workers (about 1.5 lakh) was high, the rate of incidence was likely to go up, if there was no awareness. Their number was increasing 15 per cent every year in urban areas and 10 pc in rural areas. ART They had identified about 3 lakh patients already and about 70,000 of them were under anti-retroviral therapy (ART). They were also planning to launch a unique campaign on AIDS awareness soon like the one ‘Puliraja' carried out last year. Forum convener and Government Whip S. Sailajanath said elected representatives could play vital role in combating AIDS. K.L. Durgesh Prasad, MLC, said the government policy was contradictory as on one hand it was propagating extensive use of condoms and on the other police cases were being registered on sex workers for soliciting customers.
