Telugu Desam Legislature Party (TDLP) Deputy Leader and Nagari MLA G. Muddukrishnama Naidu breathed fire at Chief Minister K. Rosaiah for using ‘foul language' while commenting on the visit of the then US President, Bill Clinton, to Hyderabad on the invitation of N. Chandrababu Naidu when the latter was the Chief Minister. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Muddukrishnama Naidu was referring to the remarks made by Mr. Rosaiah at a recent press conference in Hyderabad while reacting to the TDP barbs at him for his failure to invite US President Barack Obama to Hyderabad. The Chief Minister had sought to to ‘down play' the visit of Mr. Clinton to Hyderabad and was quoted as saying that Mr. Clinton had done nothing for Hyderabad during his visit except using the toilet. Mr. Muddukrishnama Naidu said that the remark was in a very bad taste and criticized that his ‘antics' did not behove of a Chief Minister, more so Mr. Rosaiah who always ‘bragged' about his age and experience as a mature politician. The TDP leader asked Mr. Rosaiah to recollect all what Hyderabad had gained after Mr. Clinton's visit in terms of information technology, pharma sector, US out-sourcing contracts awarded to the Satyam Computers, special package for anti-HIV campaign, etc. He said that Mr. Rosaiah would do well to understand that the TDP, as the major opposition party with 98 MLAs, was only doing its ‘constitutionally empowered' duty, when it questioned corruption and misdeeds in his administration.
