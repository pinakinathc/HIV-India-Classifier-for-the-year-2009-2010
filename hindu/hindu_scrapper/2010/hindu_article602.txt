Awareness on HIV transmission among general public is vital to eradicate the killer disease, said Collector V. Arun Roy here on Monday. Inaugurating a blood donation camp, to mark World Voluntary Blood Donors' Day, at the Government Arts College for Men, Mr. Roy said the number of people infected with HIV is high in Krishnagiri when compared to any other district in the State. To control AIDS, creating awareness among the public is a must. On an average 50 to 70 people are visiting the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at the Government Headquarters Hospital for treatment daily. As many as 17 Nambikkai Maiyam's are under operation across the district. HIV infected persons identified by these centres were sent to the ART centre. Prevention is better than cure. Hence step should be taken to check the spread of HIV. The district administration is creating awareness through special camps conducted across the district. Students should also create awareness among the general public through various modes, Mr. Roy said. Twenty students were honoured with certificates for donating blood more than 20 times. The six colleges in the district that mobilised blood from the donors and NGOs were honoured with certificate and medals by the collector. Over 500 students participated in the camp. About 36 students donated their blood. Dr. Masilamani, Joint Director (In charge), Health Services, C. Rangaraju, Principal In charge, Government Arts College for Men among others participated. T. Kavin, Project Manager, TANSACS welcomed the gathering. S. Sudalaimuthu, Manager, R.R.C. proposed vote of thanks.
