SHIVAJI RAO    A Crafts Bazaar at Sankara Hall in Alwarpet showcases the artistry and craftsmanship of over 50 artisans from across the country. From handmade lacquer bangles and handcrafted hairclips to block-printed tie-and-dye prints and embroidered dress material, there are plenty to choose from. The exhibition, organised by Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation, was inaugurated by M. Ravi, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic). The Corporation's Managing Director K. Sellamuthu participated in the function. The Orissa ikat saris and duppattas attract attention. Prashant Kumar Das, who has displayed the ikat works, explains that some of the delicate saris are the result of hard work. The longer it takes a weaver to make a product, the more expensive it is. The stall has duppattas priced at Rs.3,000 and saris costing Rs.7,000. The exhibition will be on from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and a special discount of 10 per cent is offered on all items.
