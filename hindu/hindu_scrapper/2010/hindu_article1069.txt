Sureshan presided over the function that was jointly organised by the Department of Health, Kerala State AIDS Control Society and Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust. Delivering the keynote address, deputy district medical officer K. Sakeena said gifting blood was one of the noblest deeds in life. Underscoring the World Health Organisation theme ‘new blood for the world', Dr. Sakeena called upon the youth to come forward to donate blood. “Motivating the youth to donate their blood will go a long way in our efforts to save valuable lives,” Dr. Sakeena said. “Although we need blood in every two seconds, we are yet to meet the demand,” she said.
