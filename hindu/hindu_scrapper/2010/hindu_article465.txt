Staff Reporter Coimbatore: The Coimbatore Don Bosco Anbu Illam and 30 such organisations working for the welfare of the children have demanded that all those below the age of 18 should be declared children. This is one among the 12 resolutions passed at a conference here recently where children dealt about their problems. They explained that these demands would improve the social condition of children. An increase in the educational fund for children from 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent in the financial year is the major demand to the Government. A separate Ministry for children, as they constitute 42 per cent of the total population, is another demand. “Legal action must be taken against the parents who restrict their children from going to school and send them to work and teachers who physically or mentally torment students should be dismissed from their jobs,” said Fr. Santhanam, Director of Coimbatore Don Bosco Anbu Illam. He further stated that formation of more caring communities in various parts of the city had to be encouraged by the Government which would take care of the needs of the children and protect them from social evils. One such community had been formed by the auto drivers, porters and street vendors and had been functioning effectively. The resolutions included protection of the rights of Dalit children, prohibition of child labour and child trafficking, providing employment for those parents whose children are affected by HIV and maintaining a good surrounding for the children to grow up. A survey on the condition of children in the city would be conducted shortly.
