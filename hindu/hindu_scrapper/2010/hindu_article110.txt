Staff Correspondent Raichur: The Red Ribbon Express-Phase II, an eight-coach train on a year-long journey across the country to spread awareness on HIV/AIDS, got a lukewarm response from the public, when it arrived here on Thursday. The exhibition stall run by women sex workers, who were brought together by Samraksha, a local NGO, received a good response with people flocking to their stall when they visited eight villages in the district in two vehicles. A large number of students visited the exhibition on the train. Visually challenged members of a music troupe Bidar entertained the sparse crowd with folk songs and mimicry. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), NCC students, Scouts and Guides, counsellors, members of NGOs acted as volunteers inside the train and educated the general public. Narayanappa, District Programme Officer, District AIDS Prevention and Control (DAPCU), said: “Only by protecting the rights of HIV positive people can we control the stigma.” He said that the district would strictly implement the charter on the rights of People Living with HIV/AIDS released on World AIDS Day on December 1 last year. The exhibition is open to the public till 6 p.m., and it will be in Raichur for two more days.
