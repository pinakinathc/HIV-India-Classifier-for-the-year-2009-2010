Self Help Groups (SHGs) have a vital role in promoting awareness about contagious diseases like AIDS, leprosy, TB and malaria, Joint Collector Gaurav Uppal said on Wednesday. Inaugurating a district advocacy and dissemination meeting organised by Lepra India, a non-governmental organisation, Dr. Uppal said 6,000 people in Krishna district were taking Anti Retroviral Therapy treatment for AIDS. The district administration was taking all steps to check the spread of the four diseases, but the SHGs could effectively promote awareness of the diseases.
