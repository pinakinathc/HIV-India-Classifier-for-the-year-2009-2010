The latest figure of prevalence of HIV in the State will be released next month, said P. Amudha, Project Director, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) here on Thursday. She said that the prevalence of HIV had come down significantly in recent years owing to some pro-active steps taken across the State particularly in the high-risk districts. “The latest figures based on a survey done in 2009 have been compiled and they will be published next month.
