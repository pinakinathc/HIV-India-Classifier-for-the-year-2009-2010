Australia has committed Rs. 45 crore (10 million Australian dollars) to help strengthen the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS in the North-East. The Australian commitment came in the course of a five-day visit to the north-east by Australia's Deputy High Commissioner in India Lachlan Strahan. Coinciding with the World Aids Day on December 1, Dr. Strahan met beneficiaries of Australian-funded anti-HIV/AIDS projects in the north-eastern States. C. Shekhar Nambiar, Senior Adviser, Public Affairs and Cultural Relations of the Australian High Commission said in a press release that the funds would come through AusAID, Canberra's overseas development assistance programme. The money supports a team of United Nations agencies working with civil society organisations, the State AIDS Control Societies, and the regional sub-office of the Centre's National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in Guwahati. The aim of the programme is to improve the ability of officials and NGOs in the region to fight HIV. During his visit to Guwahati, Shillong, Dimapur and Kohima, Dr. Strahan will meet government officials, the National AIDS Control Organisation, and the U.N. agencies to learn more about the situation, the media release added. “This is an important health issue for the north-east” said Dr. Strahan. “Australian support will help build capacity within the government and civil society sectors to address the spread of HIV/AIDS and assist those affected to receive necessary treatment. “Personally I am very interested to see the work being done on the ground. This is my first trip to the North-East and I have been struck by the warmth and hospitality of the local communities” he added.
