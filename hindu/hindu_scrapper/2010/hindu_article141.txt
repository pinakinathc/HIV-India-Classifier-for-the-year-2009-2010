Staff Correspondent Gulbarga: Members of the All-India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) staged a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Thursday demanding withdrawal of the Nali-Kali scheme as it had failed to fulfil the purpose with which it was launched. The protesters claimed that the scheme focussed on individual care, and the child-centric and activity-based curriculum would make teachers just an assistant. If the programme was so effective and concentrated on the development of the student’s personality, the Government should have introduced it in private schools also, they said. This clearly indicated that the State Government was following different policies for government and private schools. The protesters submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner and said that they would intensify their agitation if the State Government failed to take immediate steps in this regard.
