With the first generation of HIV children on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) entering the age of adolescence, activists have advocated drawing up special programmes for this vulnerable segment. Participants at a regional children's consultation organised by World Vision-India under its GRACE project (Grassroot Responses to AIDS through Care and Education) said the adolescents with HIV were likely to face issues of sexuality and other problems that were not being addressed in ongoing HIV/AIDS programmes. P. Manorama, chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Child Welfare Committee, pointed out that the first child adopted into the shelter run by the Community Health Education Society at the age of three years had now turned 18. “We need to create bigger platforms for the voices of these children, especially orphans, to be heard,” she said. Focussing on education as a priority for HIV children, Ms. Manorama said it was proposed to legally challenge a Government decision a few years ago to suspend the reservation of seats for orphans and vulnerable children seeking higher education opportunities. Rachana William, representing the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), said the feedback from children with HIV pointed to a strong desire for a peer support group both as a confidence-building measure and to provide a forum to discuss issues. Ms. William also appealed to NGOs to work closer with Government and also mull the possibility of forming a consortium to function more effectively and avoid duplication.
