Movement for equality: ‘My sexuality is my right,' transgender rights activist Famila used to say.    A documentary on Famila, a transgender rights activist and feminist, captures the essence of her brand of activism in one shot where she says: “I will not lead you, nor will I follow. I just want to walk by you in our battle for equality.” Her movement, which has attained some amount of success and attention in recent years, was still in its early years when she died in 2004. Her untimely death is reflective of a larger malaise, given that even in October this year, no less than 18 members of the transgender community committed suicide, transgender rights activists and friends said at a memorial service organised by Swabhava, a non-government organisation, here on Saturday. Ms. Famila was an activist and board member of Sangama, an organisation working for the rights of sexual minorities, and an active member of Vividha, an autonomous collective working for rights of marginalised sexualities and genders that organised the second Bangalore Queer Habba. It was a heartfelt tribute as people from various wings of the community of different sexual orientations came together to remember her and her role in the movement. They recalled that her dog's collar read, “My sexuality is my right”, and that encapsulated what she stood for. As young as she was, she was certain that one's sexuality could never be a “problem”, as society often perceives it to be, but a personal choice or right, recalled her friend Umesh. The focus of most non-government organisations was generally on homosexual men, as the focus was on creating awareness on HIV. “But Famila concentrated her struggle on lesbians, transgenders and bi-sexuals who were generally neglected,” said Nithin Manayath, her former colleague. Her organisation Swabhava has instituted ‘The Famila Award', which will be given to amateur filmmakers whose works will be screened at Bangalore Pride 2010 to be held on November 28.
