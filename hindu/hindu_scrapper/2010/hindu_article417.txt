Staff Reporter VIJAYAWADA: A Rs.20-crore contingency plan has been chalked out to address the problem of shortage of drinking water in Krishna district. Besides taking up repairs to bore wells, arrangements were being made to supply water through tankers to remote villages of upland mandals, said Krishna district Collector Peeyush Kumar on Wednesday. There was a drop in the ground water levels across the district and the reports of the Meteorological Department were indicating that there would be a possible delay in the onset of the monsoon this year, he cautioned at a press conference. “We have already spent Rs. 4 crore to supply drinking water and finalised plans to spend another Rs. 4 crore from the Twelfth Finance Commission grants. In all, we have to spend Rs. 20 crore to ensure supply of water for 75 days of summer,” he explained. During the ongoing Praja Patham programme, 121 representations were received from various habitations in the first two days and these pertained mainly to drinking water. Mr. Peeyush Kumar said power cuts were inevitable during summer, though load relief was now restricted to two hours a day in urban areas. There would be no power cut between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. and uninterrupted power supply of seven hours a day was being ensured to the farm sector. The Collector said the work pertaining to preparation of national population register would begin on April 26. “Each enumerator will be given only 150 houses, and only two to three houses a day will be enumerated by each enumerator,” he said, adding that the data would be used for preparing Unique ID numbers. Mr. Peeyush Kumar said Red Ribbon Express meant for creating awareness among the public about HIV and AIDS will halt on platform number 10 on April 22 and 23.
