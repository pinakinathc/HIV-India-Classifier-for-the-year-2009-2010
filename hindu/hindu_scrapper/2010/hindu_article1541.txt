FOR    A.S. Sankaranarayanan, Managing Trustee of Native Medicare Charitable Trust: “Though awareness is improving on AIDS, continuous education programmes are a must.” Managements should spend more time to increase health awareness among workers. It was important to encourage preventive measures. Industries should have tie-up with hospitals, and bring out awareness materials in the mother tongue of the migrant workers, he said. B. Mohamed Ali, Programme Manager, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit: Awareness on the disease has increased among the people. A lot of programmes are being carried out to tell them that persons living with HIV/AIDS should not be discriminated against. Yet, there are sections that still ostracise those suffering from the disease. “It is true that the level of stigma has reduced considerably, especially among the youth and students. Employers are more open to keeping HIV positive persons on their pay role. Also, the awareness that it will not spread by touch has spread among the people. But, the stigma within the family persists. This is very sad,” R. Meenakshi, President, Covai District HIV Ullor Nala Sangam, says.
