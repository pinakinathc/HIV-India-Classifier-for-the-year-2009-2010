With loopholes existing in the current blood distribution system and lack of any proven process to curb the malaise of professional blood donors, experts suggest leveraging technology to address such concerns. Such a project which is likely to come in the twin cities is being spearheaded by HMRI in the twin cities. The project, christened as ‘Tele-blood services', essentially envisages connecting all blood banks in a network and to prepare a database of blood donors to check the menace of ‘professional' blood donors. Networked blood banks will provide real-time information to blood seekers on the availability of specific type of blood required. A software is being developed that could generate alerts against professional donors and donors with HIV positive status recorded from previous donations. The project also aims to track recipients of blood units and thus control the interference of the middle men. “It is necessary to develop technology that incorporates biometric devices to track professional donors and blood receivers. The project involves capturing finger prints, photographs and issuing permanent unique identification number for persons who register for voluntary donation,” says Advisor to HMRI, Dr. P. Sangram. After the networking of blood banks, public can call up 104 call centre, which will have access to real-time information on blood availability. To check malpractices and the role of brokers, recipients or representatives of the receiver will have to submit their fingerprints with the blood banks. All this data will be collected and maintained by for a maximum of 10 years. “Public can just call 104 and access real-time data regarding the needed blood group. We are even using GPRS technology to guide the caller to reach the blood bank. A trial run was taken up when ten blood banks in Hyderabad were networked,” he said.
