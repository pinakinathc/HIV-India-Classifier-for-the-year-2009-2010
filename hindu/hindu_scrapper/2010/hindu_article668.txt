The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has granted Rs.35 lakh to G. Singaravelu, Assistant Professor and head-in-charge, Department of Zoology, Thiruvalluvar University, for undertaking research on the application of nanoscience to the control of the virus causing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Mr. Singaravelu said in a release that nanoscience finds its application in electronics and engineering by novel inventions. However, as far as biology and medicine are concerned, though opportunities exist for nanoscience application, they have not so far been explored. Therefore, the Union government organisations are at present showing interest in research on the application of nanoscience in medicine and biology. The Thiruvalluvar University would utilise this opportunity to create novel findings on AIDS eradication. “The project involves invention of eco-friendly technology for the production of nanoparticles using biological materials. It is also proposed to functionalise newly developed nanoparticles as potent anti-viral nanomaterial,” he said. Nanoscience has achieved the status as one of the critical research endeavours of the 21st Century, as scientists harness the unique properties of atomic and molecular assemblage built at the nanometer scale. Nanoparticles being one-billionth of a meter, it acquires amazing functions, he said. Mr. Singaravelu is actively involved in inter-relating research work on biology and nasnoscience. Under his guidance, scholars are doing research on nanoscience application in sericulture promotion, diabetes control, and anti-cancer drug development. He acknowledged the efforts of A. Jothi Murugan, Vice-Chancellor, and B. Krishnamurthy, Registrar of the University, in obtaining the grant.
