Various non-government organisations and people's networks on Saturday protested against the discrimination faced by a group of AIDS patients and HIV positive persons who were to be part of a consultation programme to be held at Delhi's Global Arts Village and were allegedly barred from entering the premises. “Global Arts Village is a popular meeting, consultation venue in Delhi and a non-government organisation Naz Foundation (India) had booked it as their venue for a two-day consultation on care and protection for orphaned and vulnerable children to be held on September 7 and 8… On August 10, Naz Foundation was telephonically asked by the Global Arts Village to submit a written declaration stating that none of its participants were AIDS patients or HIV positive,” said founder and executive director of Naz Anjali Gopalan. “When asked, the Global Arts Village refused to provide this request in writing citing various excuses. Naz Foundation refused to submit the declaration after which the Village authorities informed them that the booking would be cancelled. We are shocked at this discrimination against people living with HIV. Naz will now not be holding the consultation at the Village,'' said Ms. Gopalan.
