Susheela who entertained audiences with her melodies for over four decades was felicitated here on Saturday. At a charity concert ‘Gaanakokila Sangeetha Sangamam’ organised to support orphaned children suffering from HIV/AIDS and persons with physical disability, Mayor Banda Karthika Reddy honoured the vocalist, referring to her as one of the best singers of Telugu origin. “We realise the magic of music when we listen to P. Susheela’s voice. Her voice is god-gifted and her songs touch our soul,” the Mayor showered praises. Touched, Ms. Susheela obliged her with one of her classics ‘Ninnati Daaka Silanaina’ from the movie ‘Megasandesam’. “I feel blessed to sing in a hall named after Sai Baba,” she said. The charity concert was organised by Bethany Karunalaya, a home for the homeless and Sanghamitra, a not-for-profit society, at Satya Sai Nigamagamam in Srinagar Colony. About 40 underprivileged children also attended the show. Post felicitation, Ms. Susheela regaled her audience with some of her super hits, ably assisted by her singer-family members V. Ramakrishna, V. Raghu and V. Nishitha.
