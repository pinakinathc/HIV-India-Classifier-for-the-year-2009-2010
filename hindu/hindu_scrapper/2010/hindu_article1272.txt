The District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit has enlisted the support of non-Governmental organisations, Red Ribbon Clubs in colleges and the community in ending the ostracising of persons with HIV (human immuno virus) and AIDS (acquired immuno deficiency syndrome). “The first significant effort at involving the community was made at the October 2 Gram Sabha meeting held at Perur-Chettipalayam,” Programme Manager of the unit B. Mohammed Ali said on Tuesday. Normally, issues relating to infrastructure and basic amenities were discussed at Gram Sabhas. “This time, we administered a pledge to the people in the village against ostracising of persons with HIV/AIDS,” Dr. Ali said. An NGO involved in carrying out the campaign said the result of the pledge was very encouraging. Some persons offered their houses on rent for those affected by the disease. Red Ribbon Club members from a college staged a play on the adverse impact of discrimination and this caused a fair amount of awareness among the people, it said. The Gram Sabha also adopted a resolution to prevent the ostracising of persons affected by the disease. It also resolved to provide to such persons information on the treatment and other facilities being made available to them by the Government. Dr. Ali said the emphasis now was on sustaining the momentum that was set at the Gram Sabha. “We want to carry out an intensive, focussed drive. A series of programmes to create awareness will be held by involving the Government health machinery, NGOs and the community,” he said. As many as 14,300 members of Red Ribbon Clubs in 143 colleges were also part of the drive, the NGO said. The stigma was wearing off, but whatever was left should be eliminated. And, that was the present focus, he said. Besides, 26 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the district were guiding the patients on how to be part of the mainstream, in addition to following the treatment regimen.
