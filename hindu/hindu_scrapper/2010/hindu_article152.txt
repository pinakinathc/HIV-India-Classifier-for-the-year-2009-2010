Where else could you find learning on sensitive issues like HIV incorporated with a lot of fun and cultural diversity? AIESEC as a global, youth run organisation as an internationally driven learning programme called GENESIS has taken up an initiative to spread HIV awareness in the twin cities. Danger lurks HIV/ AIDS as a global epidemic threatens not only the present day youth but generations to follow with its deadly presence. With its very large scale presence in the world, and Andhra Pradesh in particular. HIV/ AIDS remains a very important social issue and we as young, global citizens know that we have to play our part in making the world more aware of this dreaded disease. GENESIS includes a total of 14 interns coming down from countries as diverse as China, the U.S., Mauritius, the U.K, and Hong Kong. These 14 interns will take part in about 25 workshops in various schools and colleges in the twin cities, educating people about HIV/AIDS, its perils, its history, the stigma attached to it, the way it affects our body and most importantly prevention methods. Learning fast “I learnt a lot of new things about HIV/AIDs today. The workshop was not only interesting but also got up such a way that it was easier for us to remember. The international presence added to the learning experience” says Saloni Singh, a Std. IX student from Obul Reddy School. “As a part of GENESIS we try to impact over ten thousand young individuals in the age group of 14 to 21 and intend to increase that number every year. All this to live up to our goals as an organisation to work towards a positive impact on society” says Nagarjuna Yadav, vice president in charge of Project GENESIS, who has a vision to impact every member of the society, everyday, everywhere.
