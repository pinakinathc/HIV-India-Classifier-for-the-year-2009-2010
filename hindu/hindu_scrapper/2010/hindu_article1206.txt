Another promising performance is in the offing for theatre buffs in the city. The Bank Employees Arts Movement, Ernakulam (BEAME) is bringing to the city the play that won awards for best play, best actress and best playwright in this year's State Amateur Theatre festival by Kerala Sangeeta Nataka Akademi, as its monthly programme. The play   (the fables of Yakshi and the rustic lore) is written and directed by theatre person K. Vinod Kumar, renowned theatre person and faculty at the department of theatre, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. And the highlight of the play is the lead female role played by Surabhi C.M., a theatre student with the Sree Sankaracharya University itself. The play is about a woman living alone struggling to keep herself safe from those who are around her to protect her. Gossips are woven around her, even that she was inflicted with AIDS. The play is about how she uses that as a shield around her. Renowned theatre person Shirley Somasundaran will inaugurate the performance at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan hall in the city on Friday.
