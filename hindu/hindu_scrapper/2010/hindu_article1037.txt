MURALI KUMAR    The introduction of mobile HIV testing centres in industrial areas and the setting up of information kiosks under Sankalp Project in Karnataka has resulted in increased awareness among workers in 15 months of its implementation in view of experts at a seminar here on Saturday. Vasanthi Krishnan, CEO of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust, which is implementing the HIV prevention pilot project in Karnataka along with Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), said 20,591 families had been covered under the outreach programme of Sankalp under the first phase of the project. She said that mobile units were working in Bommanahalli and Peenya industrial areas and 193 kiosks were functioning throughout the State. The integrated laboratory at Bommanahalli has resulted in 30 per cent increase in ante-natal case registrations and a greater willingness among workers to walk in for checkups. N.N. Mohanty, medical commissioner of ESIC, said that India was yet to understand the complete magnitude of HIV infections, with different organisations giving conflicting figures. He said that while initial positive cases were largely in urban areas, the infection had travelled to rural areas as well and was rising among women. Ramesh Zalki, Secretary, Department of Labour, emphasised on the need to target migratory workers, who travelled to cities from backward areas. He suggested that unconventional methods such as installation of condom dispensing machines could go a long away in preventing the spread of HIV.
