Staff Reporter Thiruvananthapuram: The cooperation of all government departments will be ensured while adopting strategies for the prevention and control of HIV in the State, it was decided at a meeting of the State AIDS Council, chaired by Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy, here recently. The first meeting of the State AIDS Council decided to recommend that a specific allocation for HIV prevention activities be earmarked for all departments in the budget. It was also decided at the meeting to strengthen HIV prevention activities in tribal settlements. The officials in all government departments will be provided training in HIV awareness and prevention activities. Suitable anti-HIV and HIV awareness programmes which can be implemented through the local bodies will be formulated. The council will forward a recommendation to the Department of Local Self-government to include families of HIV-positive persons in the â€˜Ashraya' scheme. The government should accord priority to HIV-positive persons in all State-run welfare programmes, the meeting suggested. HIV-positive persons should also be made beneficiaries of the Anthyodaya-Anna Yojana so that they get rice at subsidised rates. Another suggestion that the council put forth was to request the Transport Department to carry HIV/IDS prevention messages on all large vehicles at the time of registration so that the messages reach the general public. The meeting pointed out that the services of Accredited Social Health Activists can be made use of to encourage more people to undergo HIV testing. Adolescent Health Education would be included as part of the school curriculum.
