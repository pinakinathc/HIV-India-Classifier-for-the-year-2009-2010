Staff Reporter Kakinada: District Collector M Ravi Chandra has called for greater public awareness on HIV/AIDS and wanted discriminatory attitude to victims of the disease to be given up. More than the disease itself, social stigma was a painful thing to endure, he observed after inaugurating the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)'s Red Ribbon Express at Kakinada town station on Monday. Red Ribbon Express is a special train of NACO which is aimed at creating awareness on HIV/AIDS. This is the second round of the anti â€“ AIDS campaign train that began on December 1, 2009. In the first phase, the Red Ribbon Express had travelled 27,000 km across the country and it was visited by 6.20 million people at over 180 stations. Mr. Ravi Chandra said the Red Ribbon Express was educating the people about the importance of preventing HIV/AIDS which had assumed epidemic proportions. Only awareness and collective action would check the menace. The prevalence of AIDS in East Godavari district could be brought down to 1.88 percent from 2.75 percent through persistent actions by the AIDS Control Department. The district has 65 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres and two anti-retro viral therapy centres helping the victims of HIV/AIDS overcome the health problems caused by immune deficiency and psychological trauma. Kakinada Mayor K Saroja said concerted effort was needed to eradicate HIV/AIDS just as the polio menace was almost fully checked. Red Ribbon Express coordinator Daman Ahuja, Government General Hospital superintendent MBR Sarma, DMHO D Vijay Kumar, Additional DMHO and District AIDS Control Officer M Pavan Kumar and others were present.
