The film, scripted and directed by Santhosh, attempts to tell the story of a village youth lured into a sex racket. The ordinary story-telling bereft of any imagination spoils the movie. Nanda Kishore (Jagan) is the only son of Purushothaman Mash (Sai Kumar) and Saradaedatthi (Ambika Mohan). The family stays in a village. Nanda gets admission in an engineering college in the city. It becomes a life-changing experience for him. Gradually, he loses interest in his studies. Two girls he befriends introduce him to an unfamiliar world outside. One of the girls dies suddenly. She was AIDS-affected. And the other with whom he was close gets arrested following the revelation that she has been a member of an international sex racket. She is also an AIDS patient. The news shatters Nanda. He thinks that he too has contracted the dreaded disease. He begins to avoid everyone and decides to take his life. The cast includes Kolapully Leela, Salim Kumar, Machan Varghese, Kunjan, Sonia and Sarayu. Sasi Ramakrishna wields the camera. There are a couple of melodious songs penned by Sudhamshu and set to music by Prasad Njeruvissery. Musthafa's rendering of   stands out. The other singers are G. Venugopal and Madhu Balakrishnan. Nizhal is produced by T. Ashok Kumar for Aiswarya Cinemas. G. Jayakumar
