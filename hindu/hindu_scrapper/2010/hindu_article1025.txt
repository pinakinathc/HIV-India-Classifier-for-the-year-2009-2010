Making rational use of whole blood and its components is the ideal and the ultimate solution was the unanimous message of a workshop on voluntary donation. At the workshop organised by District Medical and Health Office on behalf the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) to abolish seeking â€˜replacement' donors and promote voluntary blood donation, the Indian Red Cross Society president Venugopala Rao wanted doctors motivated in this aspect. Appreciating the APSACS initiative to promote the concept, he said specifically targeted programmes for youth and doctors was essential to improve the entire scenario and wanted the Government hospitals to make a beginning by prescribing/requisitioning only components and not whole blood. Searching for donors in case of emergencies or scheduled surgeries should be a thing of the past and regular supply of blood should be ensured with voluntary donors, opined District Collector J. Syamala Rao.
