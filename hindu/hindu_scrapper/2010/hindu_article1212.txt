The long overdue amendment to the Mines Act to make the owner, lessee and officials employed to manage mining activities responsible for any accident in the mines, will be moved in Parliament during the ensuing winter session. Union Labour and Employment Minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said that the draft of the proposed amendment had been cleared by the Law Department. Mr. Kharge said that according to the present provisions of the Act, mine owners use the terminology “agent” in the Act to shift responsibility in case of an accident or negligence to escape paying compensation to the victims and their families. However, the proposed amendment would remove this lacunae and the owners, chief executive officers, managers or whosoever responsible for mining activities would be held responsible in case of a mishap. The punishment clause in the Act would also be amended. The maximum jail term would be increased from two years to seven years and the fine in the event of a mishap would be increased from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 5 lakh. Mr. Kharge said that during the winter session, the Labour Ministry would place before Parliament the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for the welfare of workers suffering from HIV/AIDS. “India has been a pioneer in implementing the recommendations of the ILO for the welfare of workers suffering from HIV/AIDS. All the credit goes to my predecessor Oscar Fernandes who took interest in extending welfare measures to HIV and AIDS patients”. To a question, Mr. Kharge said that the Union Government had also decided to extend the Rashtriya Swasta Bhima Yojna (RSBY) with a health insurance cover of Rs. 30,000 to vegetable and fruit vendors, hawkers and other street vendors. According to an estimate, there are 42 lakh street vendors, hawkers, fruit and vegetable vendors in the country. Officials have been set a target of bringing at least 10 per cent of this number under the RSBY in the next three months.
