Staff Reporter Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala State AIDS Control Society and the State Blood Transfusion Council will deploy 15 vehicles with refrigeration facilities for the safe transport of blood collected from voluntary blood donation camps to blood banks. The vehicles, each of which costs Rs.15 lakh, have been provided for the State by the National AIDS Control Organisation. While one of these will be at the disposal of the State Blood Transfusion Council, each of the districts will get one vehicle each. The fleet will be flagged off by Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy on the the premises of the KSACS office here on Friday. Each of the vehicles will have four refrigerators, which will help keep the blood collected from blood donation camps at two to eight degrees C till they are brought to blood banks where it will be subjected to various tests. The same vehicles will be used to transport the blood to blood storage centres after the tests. At present blood collected from camps conducted in the periphery are transported in ice containers to blood banks but often the quality is affected.
