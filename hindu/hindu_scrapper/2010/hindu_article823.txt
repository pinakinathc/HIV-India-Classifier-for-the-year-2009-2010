Over 200 residents of Hallada Manuganahalli and Chikkabeechanahalli in H.D. Kote and Hunsur taluks took out a protest rally here on Monday, urging the district administration to cancel the land acquisition notification issued by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Authority (KIADB) for acquisition of revenue land in the villages. Led by Raitha Krishikarmikara Sanghatane (RKS) and the All-India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO), the protesters raised slogans against the KIADB and demanded pattas immediately. Later, they submitted a memorandum to the Additional Deputy Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath. Addressing the protesters, district secretary of RKS M. Shashidhar accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of appeasing industrialists by making the life of farmers miserable, through acquisition of fertile land for industrial purposes. He criticised the Government for sacrificing the interests of farmers in the name of progress. The State was bent on creating a land bank by acquiring 1 lakh acres to offer to industrialists, as promised during the recent Global Investors Meet, he alleged. It was attempting to acquire 990 acres of land in Hallada Manuganahalli and Chikkabeechanahalli villages, he charged.
