Jodhpur: A medical college report has given a clean chit to the Umaid Hospital here, where five thalassaemia children underwent blood transfusion, saying they might have contracted HIV infection from elsewhere. The S.N. Medical College has sent the report to the Rajasthan government on the episode, which came to light when the blood of a child was tested in its microbiology laboratory. The children allegedly contracted the virus during blood transfusion at the Umaid Hospital. This was disclosed during a thalassaemia camp last year. Taking cognisance of the issue, the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society sought a report from the college as the Umaid Hospital came under its jurisdiction. D.B. Gupta, acting principal, who sent the report, said: “We follow the standardised and NACO-certified parameters in our hospitals. “There is a greater chance that they [the children] might have contacted the virus elsewhere as a thalassaemic patient many a time gets treatment outside hospital or there are a number of other reasons of infection in the children.” D.R. Dabi, superintendent of the hospital, said the blood transfusion took place about a year ago and there was little chance of the children contracting the disease from the hospital as the process of blood test was NACO-certified. However, he did not deny the possibility of infection, saying the hospital lacked advanced PCR technique for tests. — PTI
