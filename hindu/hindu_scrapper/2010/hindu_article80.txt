Special Correspondent CHENNAI: Sixteen collectives of transgendered persons from Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and Madurai received cheques for Rs. 50,000 each from Rajathi Ammal, Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s wife, for starting their own projects, at a function held here on Friday. Giving away the cheques at the programme organised by Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative, TAI Vizhudugal Federation and Voluntary Health Services as part of Transgenders Day celebrations, Ms. Rajathi Ammal said she would inform the Chief Minister of the appeal to declare January 18 as ‘Thirunangai Day’. The microfinance scheme worth Rs. 8 lakh for transgender and marginalised women, had taken off following the successful example set by transgendered women in Salem, who started an idli centre four months ago. Social Welfare Minister Geetha Jeevan urged the community to register and get their identity cards in order to benefit from the government schemes. A total of 1,777 out of 5,000 transgendered persons have consented to donate their eyes to Vasan Eye Hospital in the city. The rest of them are from various districts and their eyes have been donated to the government eye hospitals in their areas.
