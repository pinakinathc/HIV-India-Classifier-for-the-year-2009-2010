Â  | Photo Credit:  Staff Reporter GUNTUR: In a rare gesture, District Collector B. Ramajaneyulu took time off on Sunday afternoon to share lunch with inmates of Society for Welfare of HIV Infected Persons (SHIP) at Gorantla village. The SHIP with its head office located at Gorantla is one of the major organisations working for the betterment of living conditions of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Speaking on the occasion, the Collector said that though a lot had been done to minimise the travails of the PLHA the stigma attached to them still remained. It was to remove this stigma he had volunteered to share lunch and give a message to society. The district has a population of about 50 lakh, out of which there are an estimated 50,000 PLHA. According to the figures available with the District AIDS Control Society, 3,436 destitute women were living with support from Governmental and Non Governmental Organisations. The Collector said that the State Government was mulling disbursing scholarship to PLHA from BC/SC/ST communities. The District administration had completed profiling of 10,000 PLHA and has updated the details on-line. District Medical and Health Officer M. Gopi Nayak said that there were three ART centres working in the district and claimed that the district is the fore-runner in the implementation of various HIV/AIDS projects. Additional DMHO P. Uma Devi, president, SHIP, A. Rama Devi, TNT+ president A. Ramesh and Nodal Officer of District AIDS Control Society L. Madhav were present. Later, a candlelight rally marking the World Candle Light Day was held in the main thorough fares of the city. Ms. Uma Devi flagged off the rally at the Ambedkar Statue junction.
