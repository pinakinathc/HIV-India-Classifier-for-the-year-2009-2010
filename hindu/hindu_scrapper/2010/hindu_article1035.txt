Seeking reforms: A large number of students, led by eminent thinkers, educationists and writers, taking out a procession in Dharwad on Saturday.    A large number of students, led by eminent thinkers, educationists and writers, took out a procession in Dharwad on Saturday as part of the State-level convention of the All-India Democratic Student's Organisation (AIDSO). The students shouted slogans against the Government's policies on education that promote privatisation and entry of foreign universities to the country. They demanded that the Government not make education “a saleable commodity”. Inaugurating the convention, poet Chenneaveera Kanavi said the country had no definite policy on education owing to which complexities in the education sector were increasing by the day. “It is not possible to modernise our primary schools by merely supplying computers…. The teacher who imparts knowledge and inculcates creative qualities among children is an important component of the education system, but due importance is not being given to fill vacant teaching posts,” he said. Mr. Kanavi said that allowing foreign universities to operate in our country would not help improve the quality of education here. The State-run universities should impart education in tune with the social, cultural and economical requirements of our society, he added. Socialist Unity Centre of India politburo member and State committee secretary K. Radhakrishna said that problems affecting the education sector were owing to the economic policies that were guided by globalisation. Hence, the fight for the cause of education should go hand-in-hand with the fight against such economic policies, he said. AIDSO national president M.N. Sriram said the new education policies were taking education away from the people. ‘Education for all' would remain a mirage unless there was an intensified struggle by students, he added.
