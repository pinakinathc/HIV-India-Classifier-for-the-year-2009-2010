Staff Reporter WARANGAL: Incorrect reporting of AIDS and related issues by the media result in dangerous consequences, said project officer, Narender Revelli of Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR). Speaking at the ‘media consultation on stigma and discrimination' here on Thursday, Mr. Narender said wrong reporting on AIDS would only add to the misconceptions among the people. Stating that though the awareness on the issue was more, stigma attached to disease was also high and patients were being discriminated often resulting in dangerous consequences. “A suspected AIDS patient was forced to stay out of village without food and water. Before, the villagers realised that the victim did not contract the disease, she died of starvation,” he pointed out. Sharing his experiences, journalist Ch. Sudhakar of Andhra Jyothi said frequent orientation programmes should be conducted for the media persons to enable them report correctly on AIDS. WMC medical officer, Anna Prasanna David pointed out that condition of AIDS patients was no different in urban and rural areas.
