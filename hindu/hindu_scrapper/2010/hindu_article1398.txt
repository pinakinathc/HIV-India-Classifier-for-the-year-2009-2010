Ms. Indushree told presspersons here on Wednesday that the purpose was to spread message about the prevention of AIDS, and to apprise people of their duties towards those who may be HIV infected. She hopes to help dispel some myths and reduce the social stigma associated with the disease. Ms. Indushree said that in a specially designed 20-minute magic show, ‘Burnt alive: a daring escape act', she will be handcuffed and shut in a box along with the myths about AIDS and the box will be burnt, all onstage. The show will also have a small comedy routine by Krishne Gowda, a drum recital by Beats Guru, and a dance programme by schoolchildren. The programme will see many dignitaries, including Health Minister B. Sriramulu, Malleswaram MLA C.N. Ashwatnarayana, actors Pooja Gandhi and Diganth, and magician Uday Jadugar. Entry is free.
