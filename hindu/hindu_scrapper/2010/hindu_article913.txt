A mitabh Bachchan surely never fails to elicit curiosity. A good-looking old man he might be, but for people who bear a resemblance to him, life might have its share of the good, the bad and the ugly. Says Delhi-based Vishwanathan, popularly known as Nathan and who bears a close resemblance to the superstar, “ People keep clicking my photographs and compliment my looks. I feel good when they ask me for my autograph. But sometimes they ridicule me.” Remembering the first time someone noticed his resemblance to Bachchan, Nathan says, “Twelve years ago on a train a young girl asked me ‘Are you Amitabh Bachchan?' On another occasion, cinematographers from Mumbai insisted that I join the industry. But I have never taken these things seriously.” Nowadays, out of compulsion, he has to see that his hairstyle, beard and attire resemble Bachchan's. “I have been passionate about acting since my college days. For a year-and-a-half I have been sporting this French beard and hairstyle. I want to establish myself on my individual strength. I also got a call for the promos of  . But I don't want to be branded a mimicry artist,” he adds. On the other hand, his resemblance to the actor also poses hurdles when it comes to getting work. “When I go for auditions for commercials, people don't give me a chance, saying the audience does not like lookalikes. Some ask me to narrate dialogues from Bachchan's films, which I really don't like doing. I want to create my own identity,” insists Nathan. SHIVANI JAIN
