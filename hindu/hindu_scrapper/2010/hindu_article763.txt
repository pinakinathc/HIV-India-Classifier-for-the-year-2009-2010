There is a significant drop of HIV infection among children born to HIV positive mothers in the State. The prevalence rate has come down from 2.5 per cent in 2004 to one per cent now and it is set to further slide to .5 per cent. This turnaround is very noteworthy considering the fact that State figures high among the AIDS-affected States. It is largely the mainstreaming of hospitals in the private sector in combating the AIDS menace that has resulted in prevention of parent to child transmission. Denial of service, exploitation and stigma is widespread in private hospitals and nursing homes when it comes to treatment of HIV positive pregnant women. But now the resistance is gradually breaking down.
