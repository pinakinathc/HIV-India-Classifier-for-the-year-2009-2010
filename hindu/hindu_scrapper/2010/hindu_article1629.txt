File photo: AP.    The ex—chief of a Nelson Mandela charity is cutting ties with the organization because of a scandal involving a supermodel and a warlord. The Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund said on Wednesday that Jeremy Ractliffe will leave its board this month. Mr. Ractliffe was chief executive for the Children’s Fund in 1997, when Naomi Campbell says she received uncut diamonds after a charity fundraiser also attended by then Liberian President Charles Taylor. Ms. Campbell says she gave Mr. Ractliffe the diamonds as a donation. Mr. Ractliffe handed them over to South African authorities after Ms. Campbell’s testimony this month at Mr. Taylor’s international war crimes trial. Prosecutors called Ms. Campbell to help prove Mr. Taylor traded in illegal diamonds to arm Sierra Leone rebels. Mr. Taylor was also an architect of Liberia’s civil wars.
