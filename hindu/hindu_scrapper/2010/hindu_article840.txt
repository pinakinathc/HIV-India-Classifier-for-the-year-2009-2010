A part of the model-turned-actor brigade, Diya Mirza has worked with many big banners and is awaiting the release of her new films, some of them long-pending. Excerpts from an interview: It became possible with my conviction and faith. There were also benefits of my Miss Asia-Pacific title in the beginning. And of course, maintaining good relations in the industry does help in many ways. It is my honesty towards my work, which cannot go unrecognised. The length of the role does not matter for me. I am always trying to give my best. I trust my role and do justice to that. I am quietly working on various projects. Some of my movies got stuck, like Sanjay Gupta's  , and Soojit Sircar's  . I am just hoping for their release, so I cannot make any announcement now. In   my character's name is Siya, a free wild child who falls in love with a much older man. It's a beautiful story.
