Staff Reporter COIMBATORE: Free legal service will be provided to people living with HIV/AIDS in the district. M.Somesh, president of the Coimbatore Network for Positive People (CNP+), told The Hindu that seeking legal help was one of the greatest challenges faced by people living with HIV/AIDS. The Human Rights Law Network, Chennai, along with CNP+ and a few lawyers from Coimbatore, will organise a meeting on February 8 at the Divyodaya Hall to discuss the legal issues concerning HIV positive people. Stigma and discrimination in society especially at the workplace, family, and health sector would be emphasised. “Free legal service would be offered to all HIV positive people in the district on a continuous basis through this initiative,” Mr.Somesh added. There had been a lot of positive changes in the medical sector in their attitude towards treating people living with HIV/AIDS owing to consistent advocacy programmes undertaken by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and other non-governmental organisations. However, the public health centres (PHC) and the taluk hospitals did not undertake delivery of women with HIV/AIDS. Though TANSACS had appointed voluntary testing and counselling centres and laboratory technicians in all the 38 PHCs, the institutions still referred the delivery cases to the Government Hospital. “For an HIV positive person in Valparai, it would take at least five hours to travel to Coimbatore, which is extremely difficult and unsafe for a pregnant woman. In order to avoid this difficulty, the PHCs and taluk hospitals should undertake delivery cases of HIV positive people too,” Mr.Somesh said.
