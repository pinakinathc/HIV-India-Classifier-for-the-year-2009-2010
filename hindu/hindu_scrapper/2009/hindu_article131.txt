Staff Reporter BHUBANESWAR: An Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) centre, with the help of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), has been made operational in VSS Medical College Hospital at Burla in Sambalpur district. This is Orissaâ€™s third ART centre. The two other centres are functioning at CB Medical College Hospital at Cuttack and MKCG Medical College Hospital at Berhampur. According Orissa State AIDS Control Society (OSACS), the fourth ART centre will be opened at Koraput this month. Although HIV was untreatable, HIV affected people could be provided suggestions on therapies at these centres, OSACS Project Director Parameswar Swain said here on Thursday. ART comprised ARV drugs that were given to HIV affected individuals once they had advanced immune-suppression, OSACS said, adding that ART suppressed viral replication. The first ART Centre started functioning at MKCG Medical College, Berhampur, in the year 2006. Apart from ART, drugs for opportunistic infections and condoms are available with the ART centres. Persons coming to the ART centres for antiretroviral treatment as well as CD4 testing were being reimbursed their travel costs. By last November, Orissa had 11,436 HIV affected patients while 1036 were suffering from AIDS, Mr. Swain said. At present, 4,900 HIV affected patients were undergoing treatment at Cuttack and Berhampur.
