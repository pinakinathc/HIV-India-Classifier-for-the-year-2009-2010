S. Harpal Singh SHIVNOOR GONDGUDA (ADILABAD DT.): In a ghastly incident rooted apparently in blind belief, two persons from this remote tribal hamlet in Jainoor mandal, immolated themselves, early on Tuesday. Ada Sitaram (27), a Gond and Jengle Devidas (25), who belongs to the backward Mali community, set their own pyre on fire on Mahashivaratri day in the belief that Lord Siva would grant them ‘darshan.’ They had earlier led a group of 13 village youths to undertake ‘Siva deeksha’ (vow) culminating on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. The group of swamis — as the persons who undertake the vow are called — used to offer prayers to Lord Siva at a makeshift temple on Devidas’ farmland. The charred remains of the duo were found in the morning by Devidas’ younger brother, Vishnu, when he went to the temple. “We spent the night at our home listening to a recital of Sivaleela Amrut Granth, while Devidas went to the temple in the evening to join Sitaram in the daily puja. Sitaram had spent all the 40 days of ‘deeksha’ in this temple,” said Vishnu. According to Girijabai, sister of Sitaram, the latter had spoken to her about Lord Siva’s darshan even before he undertook the ‘deeksha’. The police have filed a case.
