Special Correspondent HYDERABAD: Cutting across party lines, leaders of various political parties unanimously agreed to include prevention of HIV/AIDS in their election manifesto. Legislators from major political parties resolved to put in collective efforts to fight the alarming spread of HIV/AIDS in the State notwithstanding the preventive and awareness measures. They adopted a resolution to this effect at a meeting on HIV/AIDS organised jointly by the AP Legislators Forum HIV/AIDS (APLFA) and AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) here on Saturday. Senior TDP legislator Ch. Rajeswara Rao referred to death of a weaver, who committed suicide along with his family of three besides poising his parents. While media reports said it was caused by starvation, the victim had actually contracted HIV and hence ended his life. B. Kamalakar Rao (Congress ), Srinivas (CPI ), P.V. Srinivas (CPI-M) and Venu ( Lok Satta) backed the forum.
