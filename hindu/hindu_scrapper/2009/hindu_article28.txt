Staff Reporter KOCHI: A bus-caravan awareness programme on HIV/AIDS will begin in the district from Friday as part of the National AIDS Control Programme. A bus-caravan will arrive here from Thiruvananthapuram and the district-level inauguration will be held at Mangayil Sree Narayana Park at Maradu at 10 a.m. Dinesh Mani, MLA, will inaugurate the programme that will be held in 45 venues and will go on up to February 2. The bus-caravan is a programme organised by the State AIDS Control Society in association with Nehru Yuva Kendra. There will be cultural programmes like dance, song and drama along with exhibition, slide shows and talk by an HIV-infected person. Shows will be held in three panchayats in a block and the three shows in a day will be held at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. The talk by the HIV person will spread the message against social stigma faced by those affected directly or indirectly by HIV. The talk will be on the ways the disease can spread and to counter the negative attitude of people and their perspective on mingling with HIV-infected people. The organisers have planned video shows and condom demonstration at the venues. Information and education material on the method of transmission of virus will be provided. HIV is transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, sharing of needles by intravenous drug users, unsafe blood transfusion and from HIV-carrier pregnant woman to child. With the anti-retroviral treatment available now, there are very few cases of full-blown AIDS, said Dr. Rosy Sebastian, Deputy District Medical Officer. The awareness campaign, aimed at those in the age group of 18-40 years, is part of the programmes being held in 146 districts in the country. In Kerala, these programmes have been planned for Ernakulam, Palakkad, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
