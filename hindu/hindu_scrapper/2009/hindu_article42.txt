Correspondent VIZIANAGARAM: HIV counsellors and laboratory technicians on Tuesday observed token fast at the Collector’s office to protest against the government’s indifference towards their long-pending demands that include scrapping of voluntary organisation system in spreading awareness on AIDS, payment of increments/arrears, job security etc. President L. Srinivasa Rao and secretary L. Nagaraju of A.P. State HIV Counsellors and Lab Technicians Union said that AIDS control Society in the State had handed over ICTCs, ART centres and blood banks to voluntary organisations for maintenance. The NGOs have not been paying them regular salaries and sanctioning leaves. They said that their repeated plea to Director of A.P. State AIDS Control Society was not conceded so far.
