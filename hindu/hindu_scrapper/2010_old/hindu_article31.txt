Staff Correspondent Davangere: A delegation from the Davangere zilla panchayat will urge Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to give the authority to the zilla panchayats to call for tenders and assign development works to persons concerned. At the KDP (Karnataka Development Programme) review meeting held here on Monday, Chairmen of different standing committees expressed their unhappiness over the present system of calling tenders by the Government at the State-level for various works. They said that the panchayati raj system was introduced for decentralising power but the Government was curbing the powers of the zilla panchayats. P. Ramanagowda, Chairman of Standing Committee on Health and Education, P.C. Govindaswamy, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Justice and B. Basamma, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry said that the Government calls tenders at the State-level and asks the zilla panchayat to execute the works. Mr. Ramanagowda said that this kind of system defeats the purpose of having the panchayati raj system. According to him if the zilla panchayats were given the responsibility of calling tenders, there would be more accountability. Earlier Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) said that the department had implemented 11 special programmes to train the SSLC students to do well in the coming examinations. District Health Officer Shivanna Reddy said 1,208 persons had tested positive for HIV till date in the district and of them 31 were dead.
